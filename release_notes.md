- Fix replayer bug when ghost involved, causing really slow progress at negative time
- Update [Python info](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/Hello-World_coding-example#python-binding) and scripts
  - A more flexible variant the basic scenario player script [esmini-player.py](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/Hello-World_coding-example/esmini-player.py)

  - Off-screen rendering without GFX system (e.g. headless Ubuntu):
    - Windows using Mesa3D: Put [opengl32.dll](https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest) in same folder as esmini exec.
    - Linux using xvfb: `Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24+32 & export DISPLAY=:99` then run esmini as ususal.
  - Disable feature with [launch flag](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/commands.txt) `--disable_off_screen` (potentially gaining performance)
- Lossless screen-capture in TGA format instead of JPG
  - Disadvantage: larger files
  - Advantage: Videoclips created from uncompressed files better quality/size ratio
  - Anyway it's easy to convert TGA to JPG in a post process step
  - Reminder: Add launch flag `--capture_screen` for continuous capture
- Extended screen-capture control
  - Specify exact number of frames to capture, or continuous mode (-1)

  - Collision detection. Log events and pause player. Activate with launch flag `--collision`
  - Quit at end of scenario. Activate with launch flag `--quit_at_end`
- Add route [API](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/0c18eaad53eb92bb1859e27ded3c6ddb5a1f11d4/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L1070) to esminiLib.
- Reworked action dynamics. Hopefully more correct math and behavior.
  - e.g. Lane change trajectory affected by (long) speed if and only if Dimension = time
  - LaneOffset maxLateralAcc respected ([issue #201](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/201))
  - Note that behavior might differ from previous versions
  - Changed behavior is either intentional or not, so please report suspected bugs.
  - Respect vehicle performance specification (max speed, acc, dec)
- Improved LaneChangeAction: Handle lane split cases, e.g. highway exit.
- Improved route handling: Relax lane requirement, e.g. maintain route during and after lane changes, when possible.

### 2021-06-18 Version 2.11.0

- Update behavior of the Default Controller
  - Entities will still be aligned to the road direction, but the relative heading will be respected.
    - To have a vehicle heading in driving direction (as defined by lane Id and road rule) simply set relative heading=0, or omit it since 0 is default.
    - To have a vehicle heading in opposite driving direction, set relative heading = 3.14159 (PI/180 deg)
    - To have an entity facing 90 deg left, set relative heading = 1.57 (PI/2)
    - The entity will be moved in the road direction closest to its heading, so
    - To have an entity facing 90 deg left, set relative heading slightly less than PI/2 ~ 1.57. I.e NOT > PI/2 because then it will got the other way.
  - This behaviour allows for flexible control of the orientation more independent of driving direction, see new scenario example [drop-bike.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/drop-bike.xosc) / [run_drop-bike.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_drop-bike.bat)

- Support nurbs trajectories
  - Order, controlpoint Timestamp and weight taken into account
  - Means that now all shape types are supported: polyLine, clothoid and nurbs
  - See updated example [trajectory-test.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/ec8cfbc70f3360cbf8b167b2c0eb30cb9ba65931/resources/xosc/trajectory-test.xosc#L207). (run script: [run/esmini/run_trajectory-test.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_trajectory-test.bat)) part of the [esmini demo package](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/latest).

- Visualization active trajectory
  - can be toggled with 'n' key (see [docs/readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/readme.txt) for all key-shortcuts)

- Improve object heading when following polyLine trajectory
  - Instead of interpolating heading all the way between two control points, follow the angle of the line and just interpolate a few meters before and after control point.

- Fix object orientation limitations
  - Fully separate object orientation from road pitch and bank to support correct object rotations on any road and trajectory
  - Correct pitch and roll angles will now also be recorded into .dat files

- Fix precision issue in odrplot

- Fix issue with too large OSI UDP messages
  - Now large messages are split into smaller chunks.
  - Updated [Applications/replayer/osi_receiver.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/osi_receiver.cpp) shows how to deal with it on receiver side.

- Add option to remove objects in replayer (see [replayer/readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/readme.txt) for more info)

- Add [dat2csv](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/dat2csv.py) Python script (similar to C++ application [dat2csv.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/dat2csv.cpp))

- Update .dat file format to simplify parsing in Python
  - Also ensuring portablility between Windows and Linux
  - NOTE: This change is NOT backward compatible (old .dat file not supported in this and future esmini versions)
  - Hopefully format will now stabilize so .dat files can be used between esmini versions

- Add OSI sensorData to [example code](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/ec8cfbc70f3360cbf8b167b2c0eb30cb9ba65931/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/esmini-dyn/main.cpp#L245)

- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-03-18 Version 2.5.2

- Add shortcut keys in replayer app for jumping to start and end of scenario
    - Ctrl + Left (arrow): Jump to start
    - Ctrl + Right (arrow): Jump to end
    - see updated [readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/readme.txt)
- Fix lateralprofile bug
    - All child elements to \<lateralProfile\> was incorrectly assumed to be of
    type \<superelevation\>. Which is wrong, and any \<shape\> element would
    cause broken road and popcorn effect on road users.
    - Now any \<shape\> elements are ignored (until being supported).

### 2021-03-16 Version 2.5.1

- Improve error handling
  - Always log exception messages

### 2021-03-12 Version 2.5.0

- Support freespace distance measurement

  Some conditions and actions offer a choice on how to measure distance:
  - freespace = false: Distance between the reference points of objects (low fidelity)
  - freespace = true: Distance between closest bounding box points (high fidelity)

  So far esmini has accepted freespace=true without actually implementing it, leading to no effect but the same result as for freespace=false. Now it is implemented and applied accordingly.

  Conditions with freespace option:
  - TimeHeadwayCondition
  - TimeToCollisionCondition
  - DistanceCondition
  - RelativeDistanceCondition

  Actions with freespace option:
  - LongitudinalDistanceAction
  - (LateralDistanceAction - not implemented in esmini yet)

- Fix road mark bug ([issue #83](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/83))
  The bug could cause visual defects on roads with multiple lane sections.

- Fix relative orientation bug ([PR #85](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/pull/85))
  Could result in wrong vehicle heading caused by referring to road heading before known.

  - Increase tension in ZY2Road mapping, add 2m threshold before snapping to
    another lane. Purpose is to stay in current path for driver models.
- Fix bug in Road Manager causing XY2Road to (sometimes) match the wrong road
- Add some recent esminiLib features to esminiRMLib as well

### 2021-03-03 Version 2.4.3

- Improved log file handling
  - If default log file can't be created for some reason, try with system provided temp filename. Last resort is to run without logfile, just logging to console.
- Fix Event and Action life cycle issues
  - Default maximumExecutionCount for Event and ManeuverGroup is now 1 (instead of infinity)
  - Finished Action will move to Complete state instead of Standby, making it
      possible to trig on Action being completed.
  - **Note**: This change CAN have impact on scenarios which might  need to be updated, e.g. excplicitly specifying maximumExecutionCount.

### 2021-03-02 Version 2.4.2

- Improve dat file format
  - Decouple dat format from Position class
  - Reduce file size by factor 4
  - Stabilize format: dat files can be saved and run in later versions of esmini, to greater extent than before.

### 2021-03-01 Version 2.4.1

- Add API for reporting actual acceleration and velocity of external objects
- Improve lane matching in XY2Road position mapping
- Optimize road manager XY2Road mapping (simplify road width calculations)
- Add options related to road lookahead functions
    - Lock object to current lane. Flag that will preserve lane ID regardless of
      lateral position. Useful for driving models, where look-ahead normally should start
      from the original lane.
    - Option in LookAhead function to look along actual driving direction or
      along road primary driving direction.
    - Function returns additional info: roadId, laneId, laneOffset, s, t.
- Update Hello World driver model example, utilizing new options in look-ahead function

### 2021-02-22 Version 2.4.0

- New feature: Support for OpenDRIVE road object outlines
  - support open and closed shapes
  - support both cornerRoad and cornerLocal specifications
  - add a "roof" mesh on closed shapes

  see example OpenDRIVE [crest-curve.xodr](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xodr/crest-curve.xodr) used in scenario [lane_change_crest.xosc]("https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/lane_change_crest.xosc").
    To run it, go to esmini/run/esmini and run the script [run_lane_change_crest.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_lane_change_crest.bat).
- Improve OSI performance
  - Static and dynamic groundthruth data updated separately
  - OSI API new functions: SE_UpdateOSIStaticGroundTruth and SE_UpdateOSIDynamicGroundTruth
  - Old function SE_UpdateOSIGroundTruth depricated, will be removed enventually
- Add option to tune OSI tolerances for road points (and 3D model generator)

### 2021-02-17 Version 2.3.2

### 2021-02-10 Version 2.3.1

- Fix SpeedAction distance dimension issue
- Fix ParamPoly3 arc length issue

  Motion along paramPoly3 geometries has wrongly been based on the curve
parameter which leads to wrong speed. Now the arc length is calculated
and is used instead as basis for motion along the curve.
- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-02-08 Version 2.3.0

- Add support for cubic dynamics in Speed, LaneChange and LaneOffset
actions.
- Complete implementation of laneOffset and laneChange actions
  - Obey max_lateral_acc in LaneOffset action (previously ignored)
  - Calculate correct LaneChange duration/distance based on (lateral) rate
- Minor fix: Set default value 250 kph for LongitudinalDistanceAction/maxSpeed

### 2021-02-04 Version 2.2.0

- New feature: Support visualization of OpenDRIVE road signs and objects

  The OpenDRIVE signal attribute name is used for 3D model reference. So far only Swedish speed signs are distributed with esmini. But the concept is generic and allows for customized database of many signs. The pole is separated and handled as an OpenDRIVE object, which is also supported in similar way: Name referring to 3D model.

  Updated complete model pack can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gk8bvgzqiaaoco/models.7z?dl=1), unpack into esmini/resources/models.

  See example [straight_500m_signs.xodr](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xodr/straight_500m_signs.xodr) which is used in updated scenarios:
  - [distance_test.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/distance_test.xosc) ([run/esmini/run_dist_test.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_dist_test.bat))
  - [slow-lead-vehicle.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc) ([run/esmini/run_slow-lead-vehicle.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_slow-lead-vehicle.bat))

  How to get information on road signs via API, see example usage in [esmini-dyn/main.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/esmini-dyn/main.cpp#L144)

- Some additional minor fixes

### 2020-10-23 Version 2.0.0
The major functional change is the implementation of the OpenSCENARIO controller concept. A side effect is that much of the functionality such as Ghost concept, interactive driving and external control previously assiciated and hardcoded in different applications now has moved out from the application(s) core and into different controllers which can be activated on demand in a more flexible way.

The actual application code gets much simpler and it makes no sense to have different applications for different use cases. As a result we decided to slim down to only two applications:
1. `esmini` linking internal modules statically providing full access to internal API's
2. `esmini-dyn` demonstrating use of the high-level dynamic shared library.

While doing such major reworks we also took the opportunity to rename applications and some modules, hopefully making things a little bit clearer, at least for newcomers. The changes breaks backward compatibility, calling for the update of major version number.

**Controller details:**
- Controller catalogs supported
- The following controllers, in addition to default controller, have been implemented:
  - **ExternalController**
      Vehicle will not be updated by the scenario. It's state is expected to be reported via gateway.
      The optional Ghost feature will launch a fore-runner vehicle to perform the scenario and create a trajectory for the external driver model to follow.
  - **FollowGhostController**
      An example of a (simple) vehicle and driver model using a Ghost as reference.
  - **InteractiveController**
      A simple vehicle model controlled by the user via keyboard (arrow keys)
  - **SloppyDriverController**
      Another example of a driver model, adding some random speed and lateral deviation to the default road following behavior. This controller is useless, it's pure purpose is to provide an example of separating lontitudinal and lateral control.
  - **SumoController**
      A way to integrate SUMO simulation. OpenSCENARIO vehicles are reported to SUMO, and SUMO vehicles are reported back to esmini.

These controllers can now be utilized also via the shared library. As OpenSCENARIO actions they are activated/deactivated dynamically by means of OSC triggers.

For more information about esmini controllers please see [Controllers.md](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/Controllers.md)

**Other new featuers:**
- VisibilityAction - makes object visible or invisible for sensors and/or graphics (visual presentation)

**Structural changes:**
  - Special control modes External, Internal and Hybrid have been removed (replaced by controllers)
  - ScenarioEngineDLL renamed to esminiLib
  - RoadManagerDLL renamed to esminiRMLib
  - EnvironmentSimulator removed (with controllers this got identical with the EgoSimulator)
  - EgoSimulator renamed to esmini (since it now is the recommended application)
  - ScenarioViewer renamed to esmini-dyn (kept as an example of using esminiLib)
  - OpenDriveViewer renamed to odrviewer
  - Replayer renamed to replayer
  - osi_receiver renamed to osireceiver

Note:
  - Previous use of control modes, e.g. external for interactive driving, now has to be specified in terms of controllers in the OpenSCENARIO file. Two steps needed: 1. AssignController and 2. ActivateController. See sloppy-driver.xosc for an example.
  - These changes affects some headerfile names, which might need to be updated in custom code.
  - Scripts referring to executables need updates, e.g. change any "EgoSimulator" or "EnvironmentSimulator" to "esmini" (however EgoSimulator will be provided as a raw copy of esmini executable during a deprecation period of a few releases)

- Added road model (multi_intersections.xodr/osgb) with multiple junctions. Useful for testing the shortest path functionality.
- Added new camera mode: top view (press 'k' multiple times to toggle or specify "--camera_mode top" as command line argument).
- Some bugfixes. E.g. ParamPoly3 with Normalized parameter range.

#### 2020-03-25 Version 1.4
- Demos (and binaries) supplied for Mac (Catalina) and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 and Kubuntu 18.04) in addition to Windows.
- jpeg screenshot. User can save a screen shot at any time by pressing key 'c'.
- QuitAction. User can specify when to quit the scenario (and application) by means of OSC conditions, just as any OSC action.
- Fixed timestep (--fixed_timestep <sec>). Enabling scenarios to be executed in split of a second and, by using the recording feature, it can be replayed in viewer afterwards.
- Threads (--threads). Put scenario execution into a separate thread, decoupled from the viewer. Example of potential use case: Make it possible to pause scenario while moving camera.
- New keyboard shortcut commands, and some moved to new key. Please see run/readme.txt for complete set.

#### 2020-03-08 Version 1.3
- Anti-Alias filter control
  - EgoSimulator now takes argument aa_mode <number of sub samplings>
      0 means no Anti-Alias. 4 is default.
  - One use case is when running esmini (EgoSimulator) within docker on Linux - which seem to not support AntiAlias.
- Mac CI build environment added. However only RoadManager and ScenarioEngine as shared libraries, and without graphics (OSG) support.
- Linux binaries now includes graphics (OSG) support.
- Demo package for Linux added. Now CI builds and deploy demo for both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).

#### 2019-12-06 Version 1.2
- Catalog handling updates
  - Parameter assignment implemented (enabling variants or configuration of re-used catalog items)
  - Name and structure updates:
      When a scenario refers to a catalog entry esmini will first locate the catalog by searching all specified catalog directories for a file named "catalog name".xosc. So a catalog name is defined by the base file name. Filename extension .xosc is mandatory. The actual Catalog XML element attribute "name" is ignored.
      See synchronize.xosc for an example on how to (re-)use manuever catalog entries.
- Trail visualization can be switched off by application argument (--trail <on/off>) and toggled by pressing key "t" in viewer window.

#### 2019-11-20 Version 1.1
- External control flag replaced by enumeration
    Available modes: internal, external, hybrid
    EgoSimulator and EnvironmentSimulator argument syntax changed from --ext_control <on|off> to --control <internal|external|hybrid>
