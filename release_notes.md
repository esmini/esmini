    ```c++
    for (int i = 0; i < SE_GetNumberOfObjects(); i++)
	{
    	SE_ScenarioObjectState state;
		SE_GetObjectState(SE_GetId(i), &state);
    }

  - example: `replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --dir ./dat --file variant`
  - above command will load and play all `variant*.dat` files found in `./dat` folder, simultanously
  - Note: Intented for .dat files of same length and timesteps, e.g. using fixed timestep:  
    `esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.01 --osc variant1.xosc --record variant1.dat`

### 2022-01-19 Version 2.20.0

- Add support for [OpenSCENARIO EntityActions](https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.1.1_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/EntityAction.html)
  - AddEntityAction and DeleteEntityAction supported (issue [#208](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/208))

- Fix some replayer issues
  - Repeat works again
  - Don't time-leap over empty periods states (e.g. entities temporarily deleted)
 
NOTE: To support entity actions, e.g. adding entities at any time, a change of initialization behavior was necessary. Previously all entities were instantiated at start of the scenario, regardless of presence in Init section. Now the following applies: Only entities involved in the Init section, e.g. by a TeleportAction, will be instantiated from start. Other entities can be added later by the AddEntityAction. This change might affect some scenarios and use cases.

### 2022-01-17 Version 2.19.3

  - When an event overwrites another it could happen that both step methods were applied. Now its first sorted out what events to run, then they are stepped.
- Fix replayer bug when ghost involved, causing really slow progress at negative time
- Update [Python info](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/Hello-World_coding-example#python-binding) and scripts
  - A more flexible variant the basic scenario player script [esmini-player.py](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/Hello-World_coding-example/esmini-player.py)
    - providing scenario via argument
    - quit at press Escape or end of scenario

### 2022-01-05 Version 2.19.0

- New feature: Off-screen rendering
  - Fetch rendered images via esminiLib API (synchronous or via callback) ([issue #173](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/173))
  - Example code: [image-capture.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture/image-capture.cpp)
  - Off-screen rendering without GFX system (e.g. headless Ubuntu):
    - Windows using Mesa3D: Put [opengl32.dll](https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest) in same folder as esmini exec.
    - Linux using xvfb: `Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24+32 & export DISPLAY=:99` then run esmini as ususal.
  - Disable feature with [launch flag](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/commands.txt) `--disable_off_screen` (potentially gaining performance)
- Lossless screen-capture in TGA format instead of JPG
  - Disadvantage: larger files
  - Advantage: Videoclips created from uncompressed files better quality/size ratio
  - Anyway it's easy to convert TGA to JPG in a post process step
  - Reminder: Add launch flag `--capture_screen` for continuous capture
- Extended screen-capture control 
  - Specify exact number of frames to capture, or continuous mode (-1)
  - Note that esminiLib API for screen-capture has changed, examples (old => new):
    - SE_CaptureContinuously(true) => SE_SaveImagesToFile(-1)
    - SE_CaptureContinuously(false) => SE_SaveImagesToFile(0)
    - SE_CaptureNextFrame() => SE_SaveImagesToFile(1)
- New replayer features:
  - Collision detection. Log events and pause player. Activate with launch flag `--collision`
  - Quit at end of scenario. Activate with launch flag `--quit_at_end`
- Add route [API](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/0c18eaad53eb92bb1859e27ded3c6ddb5a1f11d4/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L1070) to esminiLib.
- Reworked action dynamics. Hopefully more correct math and behavior.
  - e.g. Lane change trajectory affected by (long) speed if and only if Dimension = time
  - LaneOffset maxLateralAcc respected ([issue #201](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/201))
  - Note that behavior might differ from previous versions
  - Changed behavior is either intentional or not, so please report suspected bugs.
  - Respect vehicle performance specification (max speed, acc, dec)
- Improved LaneChangeAction: Handle lane split cases, e.g. highway exit.
- Improved route handling: Relax lane requirement, e.g. maintain route during and after lane changes, when possible.

### 2021-06-18 Version 2.11.0

- Update behavior of the Default Controller
  - Entities will still be aligned to the road direction, but the relative heading will be respected. 
    - To have a vehicle heading in driving direction (as defined by lane Id and road rule) simply set relative heading=0, or omit it since 0 is default.
    - To have a vehicle heading in opposite driving direction, set relative heading = 3.14159 (PI/180 deg)
    - To have an entity facing 90 deg left, set relative heading = 1.57 (PI/2)
    - The entity will be moved in the road direction closest to its heading, so
    - To have an entity facing 90 deg left, set relative heading slightly less than PI/2 ~ 1.57. I.e NOT > PI/2 because then it will got the other way.
  - This behaviour allows for flexible control of the orientation more independent of driving direction, see new scenario example [drop-bike.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/drop-bike.xosc) / [run_drop-bike.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_drop-bike.bat)

- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-06-14 Version 2.10.2

- Fix condition delay issue  
  Previous behavior was to return true only once after timer expired. Then, if condition still true, restart the timer.  
  Now the behavior is:
  - Timer is started when condition is evaluated to true. No more evaluations will be done from this point.
  - When timer has expired the condition will always return true
- Set correct required cmake version for FILTER feature
- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-03-26 Version 2.6.0

- Support nurbs trajectories
  - Order, controlpoint Timestamp and weight taken into account
  - Means that now all shape types are supported: polyLine, clothoid and nurbs
  - See updated example [trajectory-test.xosc](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/ec8cfbc70f3360cbf8b167b2c0eb30cb9ba65931/resources/xosc/trajectory-test.xosc#L207). (run script: [run/esmini/run_trajectory-test.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_trajectory-test.bat)) part of the [esmini demo package](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/latest).

- Visualization active trajectory
  - can be toggled with 'n' key (see [docs/readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/readme.txt) for all key-shortcuts)

- Improve object heading when following polyLine trajectory
  - Instead of interpolating heading all the way between two control points, follow the angle of the line and just interpolate a few meters before and after control point.

- Fix object orientation limitations
  - Fully separate object orientation from road pitch and bank to support correct object rotations on any road and trajectory
  - Correct pitch and roll angles will now also be recorded into .dat files

- Fix precision issue in odrplot 

- Fix issue with too large OSI UDP messages
  - Now large messages are split into smaller chunks. 
  - Updated [Applications/replayer/osi_receiver.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/osi_receiver.cpp) shows how to deal with it on receiver side.

- Add option to remove objects in replayer (see [replayer/readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/readme.txt) for more info)

- Add [dat2csv](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/dat2csv.py) Python script (similar to C++ application [dat2csv.cpp](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/dat2csv.cpp))

- Update .dat file format to simplify parsing in Python
  - Also ensuring portablility between Windows and Linux 
  - NOTE: This change is NOT backward compatible (old .dat file not supported in this and future esmini versions)
  - Hopefully format will now stabilize so .dat files can be used between esmini versions

- Add OSI sensorData to [example code](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/ec8cfbc70f3360cbf8b167b2c0eb30cb9ba65931/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/esmini-dyn/main.cpp#L245)

- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-03-18 Version 2.5.2

- Add shortcut keys in replayer app for jumping to start and end of scenario
    - Ctrl + Left (arrow): Jump to start
    - Ctrl + Right (arrow): Jump to end
    - see updated [readme.txt](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/readme.txt)
- Fix lateralprofile bug  
    - All child elements to \<lateralProfile\> was incorrectly assumed to be of
    type \<superelevation\>. Which is wrong, and any \<shape\> element would
    cause broken road and popcorn effect on road users. 
    - Now any \<shape\> elements are ignored (until being supported).

### 2021-03-16 Version 2.5.1

- Improve error handling
  - Always log exception messages
  - Handle (quit with log message) invalid object references
- Update Unity wrappers (align to current API)

- Add brief [info](https://github.com/esmini/esmini#OSI-support) on OSI to README, including OSI/Protobuf versions

### 2021-03-12 Version 2.5.0

- Support freespace distance measurement

  Some conditions and actions offer a choice on how to measure distance:
  - freespace = false: Distance between the reference points of objects (low fidelity)
  - freespace = true: Distance between closest bounding box points (high fidelity)
  
  So far esmini has accepted freespace=true without actually implementing it, leading to no effect but the same result as for freespace=false. Now it is implemented and applied accordingly.
  
  Conditions with freespace option:
  - TimeHeadwayCondition
  - TimeToCollisionCondition
  - DistanceCondition
  - RelativeDistanceCondition
    
  Actions with freespace option:
  - LongitudinalDistanceAction
  - (LateralDistanceAction - not implemented in esmini yet)

- Fix road mark bug ([issue #83](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/83))  
  The bug could cause visual defects on roads with multiple lane sections.

- Fix relative orientation bug ([PR #85](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/pull/85))  
  Could result in wrong vehicle heading caused by referring to road heading before known.


### 2021-03-05 Version 2.4.4

- Further log file improvements
  - Option to disable logfile
  - Support custom log filename
  - These features available both from command line and API

  - If default log file can't be created for some reason, try with system provided temp filename. Last resort is to run without logfile, just logging to console.
- Fix Event and Action life cycle issues
  - Default maximumExecutionCount for Event and ManeuverGroup is now 1 (instead of infinity)
  - Finished Action will move to Complete state instead of Standby, making it
      possible to trig on Action being completed.
  - **Note**: This change CAN have impact on scenarios which might  need to be updated, e.g. excplicitly specifying maximumExecutionCount.

### 2021-03-02 Version 2.4.2

- Improve dat file format
  - Decouple dat format from Position class
  - Reduce file size by factor 4

      lateral position. Useful for driving models, where look-ahead normally should start
      from the original lane.
    - Option in LookAhead function to look along actual driving direction or
      along road primary driving direction.
    - Function returns additional info: roadId, laneId, laneOffset, s, t.
- Update Hello World driver model example, utilizing new options in look-ahead function

### 2021-02-22 Version 2.4.0

- New feature: Support for OpenDRIVE road object outlines

  - add a "roof" mesh on closed shapes   

  see example OpenDRIVE [crest-curve.xodr](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xodr/crest-curve.xodr) used in scenario [lane_change_crest.xosc]("https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/lane_change_crest.xosc").  
    To run it, go to esmini/run/esmini and run the script [run_lane_change_crest.bat](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/run/esmini/run_lane_change_crest.bat).
- Improve OSI performance
  - Static and dynamic groundthruth data updated separately

### 2021-02-10 Version 2.3.1

- Fix SpeedAction distance dimension issue  
- Fix ParamPoly3 arc length issue

  Motion along paramPoly3 geometries has wrongly been based on the curve
parameter which leads to wrong speed. Now the arc length is calculated
and is used instead as basis for motion along the curve.
- Some additional minor fixes

### 2021-02-08 Version 2.3.0

- Add support for cubic dynamics in Speed, LaneChange and LaneOffset
actions.
- Complete implementation of laneOffset and laneChange actions
  - Obey max_lateral_acc in LaneOffset action (previously ignored)
  - Calculate correct LaneChange duration/distance based on (lateral) rate

### 2021-02-04 Version 2.2.0

- New feature: Support visualization of OpenDRIVE road signs and objects

  The OpenDRIVE signal attribute name is used for 3D model reference. So far only Swedish speed signs are distributed with esmini. But the concept is generic and allows for customized database of many signs. The pole is separated and handled as an OpenDRIVE object, which is also supported in similar way: Name referring to 3D model. 

  Updated complete model pack can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gk8bvgzqiaaoco/models.7z?dl=1), unpack into esmini/resources/models.

### 2020-10-23 Version 2.0.0
The major functional change is the implementation of the OpenSCENARIO controller concept. A side effect is that much of the functionality such as Ghost concept, interactive driving and external control previously assiciated and hardcoded in different applications now has moved out from the application(s) core and into different controllers which can be activated on demand in a more flexible way.

The actual application code gets much simpler and it makes no sense to have different applications for different use cases. As a result we decided to slim down to only two applications: 
1. `esmini` linking internal modules statically providing full access to internal API's 
2. `esmini-dyn` demonstrating use of the high-level dynamic shared library.

While doing such major reworks we also took the opportunity to rename applications and some modules, hopefully making things a little bit clearer, at least for newcomers. The changes breaks backward compatibility, calling for the update of major version number.

**Controller details:**
- Controller catalogs supported
- The following controllers, in addition to default controller, have been implemented:
  - **ExternalController**
      Vehicle will not be updated by the scenario. It's state is expected to be reported via gateway.
      The optional Ghost feature will launch a fore-runner vehicle to perform the scenario and create a trajectory for the external driver model to follow.
  - **FollowGhostController**
      An example of a (simple) vehicle and driver model using a Ghost as reference.
  - **InteractiveController**
      A simple vehicle model controlled by the user via keyboard (arrow keys)
  - **SloppyDriverController**
      Another example of a driver model, adding some random speed and lateral deviation to the default road following behavior. This controller is useless, it's pure purpose is to provide an example of separating lontitudinal and lateral control.
  - **SumoController**
      A way to integrate SUMO simulation. OpenSCENARIO vehicles are reported to SUMO, and SUMO vehicles are reported back to esmini.

These controllers can now be utilized also via the shared library. As OpenSCENARIO actions they are activated/deactivated dynamically by means of OSC triggers. 

For more information about esmini controllers please see [Controllers.md](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/Controllers.md)

**Other new featuers:**
- VisibilityAction - makes object visible or invisible for sensors and/or graphics (visual presentation)

**Structural changes:**
  - Special control modes External, Internal and Hybrid have been removed (replaced by controllers)
  - ScenarioEngineDLL renamed to esminiLib
  - RoadManagerDLL renamed to esminiRMLib
  - EnvironmentSimulator removed (with controllers this got identical with the EgoSimulator)
  - EgoSimulator renamed to esmini (since it now is the recommended application)
  - ScenarioViewer renamed to esmini-dyn (kept as an example of using esminiLib)
  - OpenDriveViewer renamed to odrviewer
  - Replayer renamed to replayer
  - osi_receiver renamed to osireceiver

Note:
  - Previous use of control modes, e.g. external for interactive driving, now has to be specified in terms of controllers in the OpenSCENARIO file. Two steps needed: 1. AssignController and 2. ActivateController. See sloppy-driver.xosc for an example.
  - These changes affects some headerfile names, which might need to be updated in custom code.
  - Scripts referring to executables need updates, e.g. change any "EgoSimulator" or "EnvironmentSimulator" to "esmini" (however EgoSimulator will be provided as a raw copy of esmini executable during a deprecation period of a few releases)

- Bugfix: RelativeTargetLane (used in LaneChangeAction) is now calculated correctly, skipping reference lane and considering vehicle orientation so that positive lane changes will go left and negative to the right. Scenarios making use of RelativeTargetLane might need to be updated accordingly.

#### 2020-06-18 Version 1.6.0
- OSI support, initial framework established.
- So far population of OSI global groundtruth moving objects.
- OSI data is populated and provided to user in three ways:

	2. UDP messages (option to send OSI messages to specified host/IP address)
	3. API to fetch OSI data via function call (in ScenarioEngineDLL)
- osi_receiver is a minimalistic demo-application showing how to receive OSI over UDP

  - Name and structure updates:
      When a scenario refers to a catalog entry esmini will first locate the catalog by searching all specified catalog directories for a file named "catalog name".xosc. So a catalog name is defined by the base file name. Filename extension .xosc is mandatory. The actual Catalog XML element attribute "name" is ignored.
      See synchronize.xosc for an example on how to (re-)use manuever catalog entries.
- Trail visualization can be switched off by application argument (--trail <on/off>) and toggled by pressing key "t" in viewer window.
