== Introduction
esmini is a software tool to play OpenSCENARIO XML files. It's provided both as a stand alone application and as a shared library for linking with custom applications. In addition some tools have been developed to support design and analysis of traffic scenarios.

The scope of this user guide is to provide examples on how to use the tools. It also includes a programming tutorial on how to use esmini in custom applications.

== Getting started
Download latest release from here: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/latest

First time make sure to pick the demo package for your platform (Windows, Linux or Mac). In addition to application binaries it also includes some content like example scenarios and basic 3D models. The binary (bin) packages includes only executables and libraries.

On Windows, make sure the zip file is not blocked: Right click, click Properties, at bottom right check Unblock. For more info, see <<Blocked by Windows Defender SmartScreen>>.

To install the package, just unzip it anywhere. A single subfolder named `esmini` is created. This is the root folder for esmini. No files are stored outside this folder structure and no system files or registry is modified in any way.

=== Run esmini

Try to run one of the examples:

* go to folder esmini/run/esmini
* double click on a .bat file, e.g. `run_cut-in.bat` or run it from a command line.

These scripts should work on all platforms (in spite extension ".bat").

You can also run the examples explicitly from a command line:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc``

For common Mac issues, please see <<Mac issues and limitations>>.

=== Get complete esmini
The demo package contains only a subset of esmini tools and content (e.g. scenario examples, scripts and models).

To get the complete content, first download or clone the project from GitHub: https://github.com/esmini/esmini. E.g: +
`git clone \https://github.com/esmini/esmini.git`

Then either build yourself, see step 2 in next chapter <<Build esmini - quick guide>>, or:

. Download pre-built binary package for your system (e.g. esmini-bin_win_x64.zip) from latest release:
https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases. Copy the content into the esmini-demo folder.
. Download the complete 3D model package from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5gk8bvgzqiaaoco/models.7z?dl=1[here]. Unpack into esmini/resources (it should end up in a `models` subfolder). These assets work on all platforms. The environment models (roads, landscape, buildings...) have been created using https://vires.mscsoftware.com/solutions/3d-environment-road-network[VIRES Road Network Editor].

=== Build esmini - quick guide

Supported systems: Windows, Linux and Mac.

Make sure you have a C++ compiler and https://cmake.org/[CMake] installed.

On Windows https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/[Visual Studio] is recommended (Community/free version is good enough for building esmini). Make sure to check the "Desktop development with C++" package for installation, no more is needed.

On Linux, e.g. Ubuntu, some additional system tools and libraries are needed. Run the following command:

[source]
----
sudo apt install build-essential gdb ninja-build git pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libgdal-dev libpoppler-dev libdcmtk-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev curl cmake black
----

Now we're ready to build esmini. From esmini root folder:

[source]
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
----

The build process automatically downloads 3rd party library binaries and the complete 3D model package.

After successful build, the binaries will be copied into `esmini/bin` folder. Try from command line:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc``

That's all. Details and variants, see <<Build guide>>.

== Use cases
Here follows basic examples showing some, but not all, features in esmini and companion tools. It should give an idea of the possibilities and limitations. For a full list of features and functions, see <<Command reference>>.

To quickly see available launch options, simply run the corresponding application with no arguments, for example:

``./bin/odrviewer``

=== View a scenario
==== Basic features
Specify a window and scenario file. Example: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Visualize trails from moving entities: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --trail_mode 3`

Show entities as bounding boxes: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --bounding_boxes`

.Trail and bounding box in combination
image::cut-in_trail_and_bb.png[]

==== Camera control

In addition to several OSG standard camera models esmini adds a set of special purpose camera modes that follows following scenario entities in various ways. Further, the user can add custom cameras via <<Custom camera positions,API>> or launch arguments.

Top level camera mode is selected on keys '1' to '8'. Mode 2-8 are OpenSceneGraph standard cameras. Mode 1 hands over camera control to esmini. In this mode, switch camera model by pressing 'k' which will toggle between all available esmini camera model.

The default camera model is esmini "orbit" which allows for rotating (left-mouse button), zooming (right-mouse button) and panning (scroll wheel / middle mouse button) while following the first entity.

To follow another vehicle press `Tab` (next vehicle) or `Shift TAB` (previous vehicle). Also `Backspace` is mapped to previous vehicle, since shift-TAB do not work on all platforms.

For a complete list of cameras and functions, see <<Command reference>>.

esmini camera mode can be selected by launch argument. Here are a few common use cases:

Follow exact behind vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode fixed`

Orthogonal (no perspective) top view follow vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode top`

Follow vehicle from inside "driver" point of view: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode driver`

Follow vehicle with some flex and allow rotate, pan and zoom: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode flex-orbit`

In addition to pre-defined camera modes, the user can add custom cameras from API or via launch argument. Custom cameras can be fixed, semi-fixed (fixed position but unconstrained orientation) or relative current vehicle. Here is a few examples:

Custom camera in front of vehicle, e.g. sensor mount position:
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_camera 3,0,0.6,0,0`

Custom camera with fixed position but dynamic orientation, always pointing at current vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_camera 170,10,5`

video::custom_camera_fixed_pos.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
//video::https://github.com/esmini/resources/blob/explore/doc/images/custom_camera_fixed_pos.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop"]
// video::JLrxu2CdX3A[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Custom fixed camera: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_camera 240,15,10,3.5,0.2`

video::custom_camera_fixed_pos_and_rot.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::EWsiYcovCYQ[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Custom fixed top view camera: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_top_camera 180,-1.54,2301,4.71239`

video::custom_camera_fixed_top_view.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::1Z_pCCbdxBU[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]


==== Some key shortcut commands

[horizontal]
*Space*:: Toggle pause/play simulation
*Enter*:: Step simulation one frame forward
*Tab*:: Move camera to next vehicle
*Shift-Tab or Backspace*:: Move camera to previous vehicle
*'j'*:: Toggle show entity trail points and lines (press mulitpe times to switch modes)
*','*:: Toggle bounding box modes
*Esc*:: Quit

See <<Command reference>> for a complete list of key shortcut commands.

==== Road network visualization
Visualize OpenDRIVE road features: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --road_features on`

If a 3D model representation of the road network is missing (i.e. empty or missing SceneGraphFile element of the https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.1.1_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/RoadNetwork.html[OpenSCENARIO RoadNetwork class]), then esmini will generate a _very_ simple model.

Example: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc``

Add optional flat ground plane: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --ground_plane``

The generated model can be saved: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --save_generated_model`` +
Then look for `generated_road.osgb` in the current directory.

==== Background color
esmini default background color is skyish, light blue. Change by launch argument --clear-color <r,g,b>, where r, g, b are the red, green, blue components as floating numbers in the range (0:1). Some examples:

Black background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 0,0,0``

White background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 1,1,1``

Gray background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 0.3,0.3,0.3``

==== Anti-alias
esmini make use of OpenSceneGraph sub-sampling method for anti-alias. Default setting is 4 (samples). This can be controlled by the launch argument `--aa_mode <samples>`. To disable anti-alias: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --aa_mode 0``

=== Screenshots and video clips
esmini can save screenshots in uncompressed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA[TGA] format. These images can be converted into other image formats or even video clips in a post process.

esminiLib also supports grabbing screenshots via API, also from a pure off-screen rendering setup (requiring neither monitor nor graphics hardware). See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture[image-capture] code example.

Here follows a few examples using launch arguments and runtime key commands.

==== Save screenshots
Press 'c' at any time to store a single screenshot.

Press 'C' at any time to start storing screen shot for every frame onward. Press 'C' again to stop.

==== Create video clip of a scenario
First, run the scenario and automatically save screenshots for all frames: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.033 --capture_screen``

[Note]
====
**Note** We added the --fixed_timestep argument to make sure we get a smooth video with constant delta-time for a smooth and continuous video clip. If --fixed_timestep is skipped esmini will progress time between frames according to actual system time passed since last frame, which can vary over time for many reasons (e.g. due to esmini or other processes CPU load).
====

Then, create a video clip using ffmpeg: +
``ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -crf 20 out.mp4``

The above ffmpeg command will create a MPEG4 video with reasonable compression (crf 20). To create a lossless, but still compressed, video e.g. for further post processing:

``ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -qp 0 out.mp4``

To change framerate of the output video, use the fps filter. E.g. from input 30 fps to output 15 fps:

``ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p,fps=15 -crf 20 out.mp4``

To concatenate multiple files, first create a text file listing the input files. Example:

`video_list.txt`:
```
file 'no_features_10.mkv'
file 'features_10.mkv'
```

Then run the ffmpeg command, like:
``ffmpeg -f concat -i video_list.txt -c copy merged.mkv``

*Note:* The input files must be same timebase and resolution to work well.


Get ffmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Some details regarding H.264 encoding can be found https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264[here].

==== Off-screen rendering

Whenever esmini is launched with the `--window <x-pos> <y-pos> <width> <height>` argument a viewer will be created with specified window. The `--headless` flag controls whether any window will be "on screen" or only off-screen. Of course, `--headless` in combination with no window (no --window argument) will skip rendering altogether, which is a very performance-saving mode to use when possible.

Example: +
``./bin/esmini.exe --window 60 60 4000 2000 --headless --capture_screen --osc .\resources\xosc\cut-in.xosc`` +
will render images into a virtual frame buffer of size 4k x 2k pixels and then store to file. Note: The size of the virtual frame buffer is not limited by size of any connected display.

To run esmini completely without rendering, just omit the --window argument: +
``./bin/esmini.exe --osc .\resources\xosc\cut-in.xosc`` --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat +
will run the specified scenario quickly and store a .dat file for later analysis or viewing (with replayer).

*Note:* If --fixed_timestep is omitted esmini will adapt timesteps to actual frametime, so a 30 seconds scenario will take 30 seconds - i.e. no performance gain.

==== Software rendering (no gfx hw)

By default any available 3D graphics hardware will be utilized. As fallback esmini (via OSG) will utilize https://www.mesa3d.org[Mesa3D] which is a software implementation of the OpenGL graphics stack including parts normally hosted in the graphics hardware system. The Mesa3D approach is useful when running on cloud/cluster machines lacking graphics hardware, perhaps even lacking a window system (like slimmed and headless Ubuntu without X11 support).

*Mesa3D on Linux* +
Mesa3D is normally installed with Linux distributions. Check OpenGL support with the following command: +
``glxinfo -B``

If the command is not available, then Mesa3D utility package is probably missing. Install as: +
``sudo apt install mesa-utils``

To run headless with a virtual frame buffer:

- Activate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb[xvfb]: +
``Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24+32 & export DISPLAY=:99`` +
- Then run esmini as usual

For troubleshooting, the following command might give information about the graphics system: +
``lspci -vnn | grep VGA -A 12``

*Mesa3D on Windows* +

- Grab the Mesa3D binary from https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest[here].
- Unpack and place opengl32.dll in the same folder as esmini executable.
- Then run esmini as usual

=== Logging
esmini can produce log files in different formats and for different purposes, explained next.

==== The basic text log file
By default esmini is creating a `log.txt` in the folder from which esmini is launched. In case of esminiLib it will end up in the folder that the application linking esminiLib was launched from. The log filename can be customized.

The log file includes the same information normally seen in the terminal window (stdout).

To disable output to terminal: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --disable_stdout``

To disable creation of the logfile (`log.txt`): +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --disable_log``

esmini has enhanced logger from release v2.41.0 supporting log verbosity levels, log file appending, enabling/disabling meta data and filtering on module level logging.

===== Log verbosity
There are four log verbosity levels:

. error
. warn
. info
. debug

The log level can be set from command line argument. If not provided, then `info` level is set by default. Log verbosity goes from `error` (low) to `debug` (high). Log entries will be included from `error` up to the specified level.

Example 1: `--log_level debug` will include all entries (`error`, `warn`, `info` and `debug`) as the highest level has been selected.

Example 2: `--log_level warn` will include `error` and `warn` entries only.

Developers can use `LOG_ERROR`, `LOG_WARN`, `LOG_INFO` and `LOG_DEBUG` macros to effectively prioritize log messages.

===== Log metadata
Logger can add source code meta data with every logged entry, including:

- file name
- function/method name
- line number

indicating the location of the log entry in the source code.

`--log_meta_data` is the command line parameter for enabling meta data.

===== Log append
`--log_append` is another command line option. Instead of overwriting any existing log file, entries will be appended to the same log file. In other words, logs of multiple scenarios will be put in the same single log file.

===== Log filtering on modules
If there is a need to gather log entries of any particular module(s) i.e. hpp/cpp file then `--log_only_modules` option can be set from the command line. It will create a filter for the logger to pick only log entries from specified modules, ignoring all others. Example:

`--log_only_modules playerbase`

will only log from `playerbase.hpp/cpp` files. All other log entries will be skipped.

Opposite to log only modules, there is an option to skip specific modules. Example:

`--log_skip_modules playerbase,Replay`

will skip all log entries from `playerbase.hpp/cpp` and `Replay.hpp/cpp` files. Entries from all other modules will be included.

Note that `--log_only_modules` and `--log_skip_modules` are mutually exclusive. If a module is listed in both options, then priority is given to `--log_only_modules`. Hence logging will be enabled for specified module, ignoring its presence in `--log_skip_modules`.

===== Log use case example

Assume you're only interested in storyboard events, like actions and triggers. First step is to run a representative scenario to find out what modules you're interested in. Example:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --log_meta_data`

It will show all log entries up to `info` level, including meta data. Look for the module names in the log entries. Then run the scenario again with module filter. Example:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --log_only_modules Storyboard,StoryboardElement,OSCCondition`

It will show only log entries relating to storyboard, including triggering. Example excerpt:

==== Scenario recording (.dat)
In addition esmini can save a `.dat` file which captures the state of all entities. This file can later be used either to replay (see <<Replay scenario>>) the scenario or converted to `.csv` for further analysis, e.g. in Excel.

To create a recording with regular timesteps: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --record sim.dat``

To convert the .dat file into .csv, do either of: +
``./bin/dat2csv sim.dat`` +
or +
``python ./scripts/dat2csv.py sim.dat``

Only a subset of the .dat file information is extracted. To extract some more info, e.g. road coordinates, run:
``./scripts/dat2csv --extended sim.dat`` +

You can create .dat files from multiple scenarios in a single command, like this on Linux (bash):

for f in ./my_scenarios/*.xosc; do ./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc $f --record `basename $f .xosc`.dat; done
----

It also works in Git bash on Windows.

==== CSV logger
To create a more complete csv logfile, compared to the content of the .dat file, activate the CSV_Logger:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --csv_logger full_log.csv``

full_log.csv will contain more detailed states for all scenario entities. To also include collision detection: +

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --csv_logger full_log.csv --collision``

All collisions (overlap) between entity bounding boxes will be registered in the `collision_ids` column of each entity. It will contain the IDs of any entities overlapping at given frame.

=== Replay scenario

Replay a scenario recording (.dat file): +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --file sim.dat``

The `--res_path` is a special path directive should normally point to esmini/resources folder, where it will look for the OpenDRIVE file, 3D models and model_ids table (model_ids.txt). It also works to add one or multiple --path <path> directives, like for esmini.

Once loaded the scenario recording will start playing in normal speed. Here are a few key commands:

[horizontal]
*Space*:: Toggle pause/play simulation
*Tab*:: Move camera to next vehicle
*Shift-Tab or Backspace*:: Move camera to previous vehicle
*'n'*:: Toggle show active trajectories
*','*:: Toggle bounding box modes
*Esc*:: Quit

Arrow keys:
[horizontal]
*Left*:: Pause and move to previous frame
*Right*:: Pause and move to next frame
*Shift + Left*:: Pause and jump 10 frames back
*Shift + Right*:: Pause and jump 10 frames forward
*Ctrl + Left*:: Jump to beginning
*Ctrl + Right*:: Jump to end

See <<Command reference>> for a complete list of key shortcut commands.

Some launch arguments:
[horizontal]
*--collision*:: Pause and move to previous frame
*--quit_at_end*:: Quit application when reaching end of scenario
*--repeat*:: Loop scenario
*--dir <path>*:: Directory containing replays to overlay, pair with "file" argument, where "file" is .dat filename match substring

Examples:

Enable collision detection and pause playing at every occasion of collision:  +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim.dat --res_path ./resources --collision``

.Video clip demonstrating some features in replayer
video::ltap-od_collision.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::54NWtG1MsRk[youtube,width=800,height=400,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

The .dat file in the clip above was created with the command: +
``./bin/esmini --headless --osc ./resources/xosc/ltap-od.xosc --disable_controllers --fixed_timestep 0.033 --record sim.dat ``

and then launched in replayer: +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim.dat --res_path ./resources --collision``

*Note:* The --disable_controllers flag is just specified to disable the interactive controller that normally is activated in that specific scenario. For more information about controllers, see https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/Controllers.md[Controllers in esmini].


Combine esmini and replayer in a one-liner command: +
``./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --record sim.dat --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc;./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --file sim.dat``

With bash (use Git Bash on Windows) preview all scenarios (.xosc files) in a folder, at double speed: +
``for f in my_scenarios/*.xosc; do ./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc $f --record `basename $f .xosc`.dat;./bin/replayer --window 60 60 1200 600 --res_path ./resources --file `basename $f .xosc`.dat --time_scale 2 --quit_at_end; done``

just replace `my_scenarios` with your folder path

==== Multiple scenarios in parallel

Next example, play multiple variants of a scenario in parallel: +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim --res_path ./resources --capture_screen --dir tmp``

The `--dir` argument points to a folder containing sim1.dat, sim2.dat and sim3.dat. +
The `--capture_screen` argument will save each frame as an image file on disk.

.Video clip demonstrating parallel scenarios in replayer
video::replay_multiple_scenario_variants.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::KqoTmAE9NmI[youtube,width=800,height=400,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

==== Save merged .dat files

Merged data from multiple .dat files can be saved into one single .dat file, e.g. for plotting: +
``./bin/replayer --file sim_ --dir . --save_merged sim_merged.dat``

replayer will look in current folder (".") for any .dat file starting with "sim_", i.e. "sim_*.dat". The files will be merged and saved as sim_merged.dat.

=== View road network

==== Visualize OpenDRIVE geometry

By default odrviewer will create a simple 3D model of the OpenDRIVE description and populate it with sparse traffic: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr``

Add OpenDRIVE features, like reference line and lanes, on top (toggle on 'o'): +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --road_features``

Remove all traffic, just visualize the road geometry: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --density 0``

==== Evaluate OpenDRIVE connectivity

Increase traffic to exercise all junctions and lanes of the road network: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --density 7 --road_features``

Use custom 3D model: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --model ./resources/models/fabriksgatan.osgb --density 5``

Slow down traffic: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --model ./resources/models/fabriksgatan.osgb --density 3 --speed_factor 0.6``

==== Inspect OpenDRIVE geometry and road IDs

esmini odrplot is a small application that creates a track.csv file that can be plotted with another small Python script xodr.py: +
``./bin/odrplot ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr`` +
``./EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/odrplot/xodr.py track.csv``

Combine in a one-liner: +
``./bin/odrplot ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr;./EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/odrplot/xodr.py track.csv``

To navigate in the plot, click the four-arrow icon (see image below) and then use mouse according to:
[horizontal]
*Left button*:: Pan (move left, right, up, down)
*Right button*:: Zoom

image::odrplot_help.png[]

=== Plot scenario data

esmini can plot data in two ways: Off-line (plot content of .dat files) and runtime (a set of pre-defined values).

==== Off-line plotting
esmini provides a Python based script, plot_dat.py, to plot information in .dat files.

First, create a .dat file. For that we don't need a window. Run esmini headless: +
``./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/acc-test.xosc --record sim.dat``

The scenario looks like this: +

video::acc-test.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]

Next, plot speed over time: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed``

image::plot_dat.png[]

To see what parameters are available for plot: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --list_params``

will output a list similar to: +
``
Plottable parameters: +
id, model_id, obj_type, obj_category, ctrl_type, time, speed, wheel_angle, wheel_rot, centerOffsetX, centerOffsetY, centerOffsetZ, width, length, height, scaleMode, visibilityMask, x, y, z, h, p, r, roadId, laneId, offset, t, s
``

Most parameters does normally not make sense to plot, but it depends on the test case. Maybe it's interesting to see when a car makes a lane change. Plot laneId over time: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param laneId``

image::plot_dat_lane_id.png[]

A plot can show multiple parameters: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param laneId --param speed``

image::plot_dat_lane_speed.png[]

To plot trajectories, change X-axis parameter from `time` to `x` and plot `y` parameter (over x): +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --x_axis x --param y``

image::plot_dat_x_y.png[]

Lock axis aspect ratio, i.e. make axis scale equal: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --x_axis x --param y --equal_axis_aspect``

image::plot_dat_x_y_eq_axis.png[]

Plot merged .dat files (created as described in <<Save merged .dat files>>) +

``./scripts/plot_dat.py --param speed sim_merged.dat``

image::plot_merged_dat_files.png[]

Entity IDs will get an offset multiplier of 100, corresponding to the order of which the dat files were read by replayer. The mapping between ID range and dat file is printed to the console by replayer when the merged dat file is created, as the following example of four input files:

[listing]
Scenarios corresponding to IDs (0:99): sim_fsm.dat
Scenarios corresponding to IDs (100:199): sim_ref.dat
Scenarios corresponding to IDs (200:299): sim_reg.dat
Scenarios corresponding to IDs (300:399): sim_rss.dat

==== Runtime plotting

From version 2.32.0 esmini can plot some pre-configured data values during simulation. Simply add launch flag `--plot`.

Features so far:

- One or multiple entities can be selected by checkboxes on top
- Selection of variables can be reduced by checkboxes to the right

.Screenshot of a cut-in scenario with line plotting feature enabled
image::implot.png[]

By default the plotting is executing in a separate thread, having minimal impact on esmini performance. It is also possible to execute in synchronous mode, where plotting is part of esmini main thread and stepping is done in synch. The mode can be specified explicitly. Examples:

Simply enable plotting, default mode:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --plot`

Enforce synchronous mode:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --plot synchronous`

Asynchronous mode can be specified as well, although it's default hence not needed:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --plot asynchronous`

*Note:* On macos OpenGL window must be part of main thread. Hence synchronous mode is enforced on macos.

=== Save OSI data
esmini can provide OSI groundtruth data in three ways:

. Send over UDP
. API to fetch via function call from a custom application
. Save to OSI trace file

Only trace file way is described here. To save OSI data, add argument `--osi_file [filename]`. The filename is optional. If omitted it will be named `ground_truth.osi`. Example:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --osi_file``

will create `ground_truth.osi` in the current folder. The format is according to the OSI standard "Binary trace file", see OSI documentation https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-documentation/index.html#_osi_trace_files[2.2.6 OSI trace files].

esmini provides a script, osi2csv.py, that converts an OSI trace file into .csv format. The script can also serve as example how to parse and extract data from an OSI trace file:

``./scripts/osi2csv.py ground_truth.osi``

will create ground_truth.csv. +
(if file type association is not setup, try: ``python ./scripts/osi2csv.py ground_truth.osi``)

However the .csv file created with osi2csv will not contain all OSI information. To get a readable text file including the complete content of a OSI trace file you can make use of the Python script https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface/blob/v3.5.0/format/osi2read.py[format/osi2read.py] in the OSI project.

Use as following example:

`../open-simulation-interface/format/osi2read.py --data ./ground_truth.osi --output ground_truth --type GroundTruth`

it should create `ground_truth.txth` which is readable in a text editor.

[Note]
====
**Note**:

See <<OSI for Python on Windows>> for hints how to install dependencies (OSI and Protobuf).

The above script link points to OSI tag v3.5.0. In more recent OSI versions the script has moved to another folder: https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface/blob/master/osi3trace/osi2read.py[osi3trace/osi2read.py].

== Scenario features
=== Speed profile
(introduced in esmini v2.23.0)

The OpenSCENARIO https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.1.1_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/SpeedAction.html[SpeedAction] will reach a specified speed in a way described by additional attributes, e.g. shape and duration. To achieve multiple speed target over time you would need to add multiple SpeedAction events to the scenario. Moreover, there is no way to explicitly control the jerk (acceleration/deceleration rates).

However with the SpeedProfileAction (introduced in OpenSCENARIO v1.2) you can specify a series of speed targets over time, in one action. Optionally you can also specify dynamic constraints for jerk (gradually changing acceleration and deceleration), acceleration and speed.

If you run the example scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc[speed-profile.xosc] as follows:

[source]
----
./bin/esmini.exe --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat
./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed
----
you should get the following plotted speed curves:

image::speed-profile1.png[]

*Note:* You might need to add ``python`` or ``python2`` in front of the python command. And matplotlib is needed, see odrplot in <<Tools overview>>.

*Tip:* For quick experiments, skip the visualization and bring the plot asap by replacing the two commands with:
[source]
----
./bin/esmini.exe --headless --osc ./resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat;./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed
----

The scenario includes two cars with identical speed profiles with one exception: The white Car1 use activate dynamic constraints by setting FollowingMode="follow" while the red Car2 will apply constant acceleration (linear interpolation) between speed targets by setting FollowingMode="position".

The action for white car:

[source,xml]
----
<SpeedProfileAction followingMode="follow">
    <DynamicConstraints
        maxAcceleration = "5.0"
        maxDeceleration = "10.0"
        maxAccelerationRate = "4.0"
        maxDecelerationRate = "3.0"
        maxSpeed = "50"
    />
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="4.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="2.0" speed="8.0"/>
</SpeedProfileAction>
----

The time values are relative each other and start of the action. In this case the action is triggered at simulation time = 2 seconds. Initial speed for both cars is 0. First entry has therefor no effect since it applies speed = 0 at time = 2 (2 + 0). After additional 4 seconds (sim time = 6s) the speed target is 10 m/s. At sim time 10s the speed target is 4 m/s and finally after 2 more seconds the final speed target value is 8.0 m/s.

The "follow" mode deserves some additional explanation. As shown in the figure, it start and ends with zero acceleration. Then is basically will try to match the acceleration "lines" but cutting the corners according to acceleration and deceleration rate constraints. This way the intermediate speed values will not always be reached. However, the final speed value will be reached.

If the target speed or accelerations can't be reached with given constraints the action will revert to linear mode (FollowingMode="position") for the remainder of the profile. This "failure" is logged.

Another approach would be to try to perform a best effort, but that would require additional input to decide whether to prioritize reaching specified speed targets or respect time stamps...


[Note]
====
**Note**: The implementation of this feature is preliminary and experimental. Behavior and details might change.
====

Let's manipulate the scenario in different ways to illustrate some special cases of the speed-profile feature.

==== Special case: Single entry
(Special case implementation introduced in esmini v2.23.1)

Compared to SpeedAction, the SpeedProfileAction offers more tools in terms of dynamic constraints. Hence it can be actually be useful also for single entry, i.e. reach a single target speed.

The implementation differs for the single entry case. Target speed will be reached if constraints allows for it. If not, the speed will still be reached, but later than specified.

There are three sub cases:

*1. Speed can be reached within time*

The speed profile will contain three phases: Jerk, constant acceleration, jerk.

Example: +
Replace the four entries in speed-profile.xosc with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile5.png[]

Initial positive jerk will be applied until necessary acceleration is reached. Keep constant acceleration (linear segment in the speed profile) until negative jerk needs to be applied in order to reach target speed on time and at zero acceleration.

*2. Speed can't be reached in time due to acceleration constraints*

This speed profile will also contain three phases: Jerk, constant acceleration, jerk.

Example: +
Replace the four entries in speed-profile.xosc with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile6.png[]

Initial positive jerk will be applied until maximum acceleration is reached (or maximum deceleration). Keep constant acceleration (linear segment in the speed profile) until negative jerk needs to be applied in order to reach target speed at zero acceleration. Due to the acceleration limitation there will be a delay as well. The log file will include something like:

[source]
----
SpeedProfile: Constraining acceleration from 5.86 to 5.00
SpeedProfile: Extend 0.46 s
----

*3. Speed can't be reached in time due to jerk constraints*

This speed profile will contain only two jerk phases.

Example: +
Keep entries from last case, but change jerk settings as follows:

[source,xml]
----
  maxAccelerationRate="3.0"
  maxDecelerationRate="2.0"
----

image::speed-profile7.png[]

In this case the jerk settings are too weak to reach target speed in time. Not enough acceleration can be achieved in the given time window.

Positive jerk will be applied until negative jerk has to be applied in order to reach target speed at zero acceleration. Hence there is no room for a phase of constant acceleration. Due to the jerk limitation there will be a delay. The log file will include something like:

[source]
----
SpeedProfile: Can't reach target speed 10.00 on target time 3.00s with given jerk constraints, extend to 4.08s
----

==== What if current speed differ from the first entry?
Replace the four entries with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="3.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile2.png[]

What we see here is that for linear mode (FollowingMode="position") the speed of the first entry will apply immediately regardless of the current speed at the time of the action being triggered. For constrained mode (FollowingMode="follow") we see that the initial speed value (3.0) is overridden by the current speed (0.0). From there it will strive for the second entry, obeying the constraints.

The overall idea with the "follow" mode is to maintain continuity in the speed profile, up to jerk degree.

==== What if time is missing in entry?

Replace any entries with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile3.png[]

Specified max acceleration will be applied until target speed is reached. Note: In the non-linear case and with multiple entries, the function will fail if the specified acceleration can't be reached with given jerk constraints (maxAcceleration and maxDeceleration). Try to lower the maxAcceleration/deceleration in this case.

You can also combine entries with and without time constraint, like in following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry speed="10.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="15.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile4.png[]

Car will accelerate until speed 10 m/s is reached, then spend 3 seconds to reach 15 m/s.

==== Initial acceleration taken into account
(from release v2.23.2)

What if the acceleration is not zero when the SpeedProfileAction is started, for example interrupting an ongoing SpeedAction in Follow mode?

To maintain a continuous acceleration profile the action will use current acceleration as initial value. The standard states that the acceleration is expected to be zero at start and end of the action. The esmini interpretation is that the CHANGE is zero at start while the ACTUAL value is zero at end (since the action can only control acceleration while being active, not before).

Example:
Once again starting from https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc[speed-profile.xosc], instead of setting an instant initial speed make it ramp up from 0 to 5 m/s over a duration of 4 seconds by tweaking the initial speed actions, for both entities, as below:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedActionDynamics dynamicsShape="linear" value="5.0" dynamicsDimension="time"/>
    <SpeedActionTarget>
        <AbsoluteTargetSpeed value="4.0"/>
    </SpeedActionTarget>
----

image::speed-profile8.png[]

The initial speed action will apply constant acceleration until time = 2.0 seconds, when the SpeedProfileAction is triggered. While the linear profile will jump to 0 m/s (as specified in first entry) the follow mode profile will just apply necessary jerk to reach target acceleration with respect to following entries.

Initial acceleration is also respected for the special case of a single entry, for example:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

the result becomes:

image::speed-profile9.png[]

==== Sharp brake-to-stop profile

To skip jerk phase, e.g. as in emergency brake with an abrupt stop, just set AccelerationRate to a large number.

Example:
Once again starting from https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc[speed-profile.xosc], change speed in the Init speed actions to 10.0 and replace the speed profile actions as below:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileAction followingMode="follow">
        <DynamicConstraints
            maxAcceleration = "5.0"
            maxDeceleration = "10.0"
            maxAccelerationRate = "1E10"
            maxDecelerationRate = "3.0"
            maxSpeed = "50"
        />
        <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="10.0"/>
        <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="0.0"/>
    </SpeedProfileAction>
----

image::speed-profile10.png[]

*Note*: A drawback is that the setting will affect any acceleration phase in the complete profile. In other words, a limitation is that entries can't have individual settings. In the example above it's not problem since the first jerk phase is a deceleration while the second is an acceleration. If different rate values of same type are needed, it can be achieved by defining multiple SpeedProfile actions in a sequence, with individual performance settings.

==== More info
To get more understanding of the implementation, see a few slides https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmjVHftcsbU71Ce_GASZ6IArcPA6teNF/view?usp=sharing[here].

=== Condition delay

Conditions can be delayed individually. A simple use case is to delay the closure of a scenario run, for example three seconds after any collision.

It gets more flexible, and complex, when combining delay with grouping, which is a way to represent AND and OR logical operations, see https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/07_components_scenario/07_06_conditions_triggers.html#_triggers_and_condition_groups[OpenSCENARIO XML v1.3 User guide - Triggers and condition groups].

Consider the following example, based on the test scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/condition_delay.xosc[condition_delay.xosc] (used by test case TestConditionDelay in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/ScenarioEngine_test.cpp[ScenarioEngine_test]).

The scenario is basically one car accelerating linearly from 50 to 100 km/h (13.9 - 27.8 m/s) during two seconds, and then decelerating back to 50 km/h, again over two seconds. The speed is greater than 25 m/s in the time window 3.2 - 4.8 seconds. By 6.0 seconds the speed has decreased to 20.8 m/s.

There is one event including a LaneChange action and a StartTrigger containing three condition groups:

[%autowidth, cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
||*condition*|*delay*|*edge*
|*Group1*|C1: SimulationTime ≥ 6.0|0.0|none
||C2: Speed ≥ 25.0|0.0|none
|*Group2*|C3: SimulationTime ≥ 6.0|0.0|none
||C4: Speed ≥ 25.0|2.0|rising
|*Group3*|C5: SimulationTime ≥ 6.0|0.0|none
||C6: Speed ≥ 25.0|4.0|none
|===

Briefly, the action will happen whenever all (two) conditions within any of the three groups becomes true. It can be illustrated as below.

image::condition_delay.png[]

The solid blue curve represents the speed profile. The two dashed curves represents the speed profile as interpreted by the two delayed speed conditions. The yellow area above the horizontal thick line represents speed ≥ 25 m/s. The blue area to the right of the vertical thick line represents time ≥ 6.0 s.

The first gray pyramid illustrates when condition C2 evaluates true. The gray dot represents when C4 evaluates true. The red pyramid represents C6 = true. Only the red pyramid is in the blue area (time ≥ 6s). In summary, only group 3 will evaluate to true. More specifically, it will become true as soon as speed becomes greater than 25 m/s, which happens at 7.2 seconds, which is passed 6 seconds.

Hopefully the above example gives some idea how condition delay works and how it can be utilized.

=== Road signs
(framework updated in esmini v2.25.0)

==== The system

Road signs are specified in the https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=4422&token=e590561f3c39aa2260e5442e29e93f6693d1cccd#top-016f925e-bfe2-481d-b603-da4524d7491f[OpenDRIVE] road network description file. A road sign is identified by up to four parameters:

. country code
. type
. subtype
. value

Country code is a two letter word according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 system]. Examples: Sweden = se, Germany = de.

Type and subtype defines the semantic meaning of the sign. The value is used when applicable to further specify information, e.g. speed or weight. Data type and meaning of the parameters may differ between countries. However a mapping to each country's system is often feasible.

Examples:
In https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/sv/vagtrafik/Vagmarken/[Sweden a speed sign] belongs to the category prohibition signs named "c". Within that category speed signs is a sub group with index 31. Within that group each sign has a value of speed/10, e.g. 5=50km/h, 10=100km/h. So the parameters for a Swedish speed limit 90 km/h sign becomes: se, c, 31, 9.

In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Germany[Germany] there are no similar categories. Instead all signs have a unique group or type number, e.g. speed signs make up group 274. Then the value defines the speed. No need for subtype. So the parameters for a German  speed limit 90 km/h sign becomes: de, 274, -, 90.

==== esmini sign catalogs
Instead of hard-coding road sign support esmini will lookup the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/open-simulation-interface/structosi3_1_1TrafficSign_1_1MainSign_1_1Classification.html[OSI code] from a separate sign definition file, which is unique for each country. Name convention for the file is: `country code` + "_traffic_signals.txt". Example: Swedish catalog is named "se_traffic_signals.txt".

The file is a simple text format each line defining a sign ID and corresponding OSI type.

Swedish example: `c.31-7=TYPE_SPEED_LIMIT_BEGIN` +
German example: `274=TYPE_SPEED_LIMIT_BEGIN`

Type is mandatory. For esmini to distinguish between subtype and value different separators are used: "." before subtype and "-" before value. For some signs the value is optional, e.g. for speed signs it simply specify the speed limit. But for some signs it is used as a subtype to identify a variant of a sign, as in the German 101 type category.

Example files can be found in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/resources/traffic_signals[esmini/resources/traffic_signals].

Currently (v2.25.0) the esmini sign support is very limited. However, it should be fairly straight forward to add signs into existing catalogs and even catalogs (for more countries).

==== Sign 3D models
esmini road signs are created as follows:

- A basic 3D geometry is modeled in Blender, e.g. round face for speed signs
- Assign a material with any texture image mapped on the sign face
- The 3D model is exported in `.dae` format (example https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=11v7xz9Mqw_Vx4An_FoLfKVlwcWJc-mnE[here])

- Find textures of the needed sign(s) and convert them into some common format, e.g. `.png`. Recommended size is 256, but larger is OK. If possible make it size 2^n x 2^m to avoid performance penalty on low spec/old systems.
- Rename image to the same name as the texture image in the dae file (sign_image.png in the example dae)
- Convert the .dae file into .osgb using osgconv. The texture will be embedded in the.osgb file by default.

.Speed sign in Blender
image::speed_sign_blender.png[]

A https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/bake_signs.sh[script] is available as a starting point for automating the two last steps in the process above.

==== Example

The OpenDRIVE file https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xodr/straight_500m_signs.xodr[straight_500m_signs.xodr] includes a bunch of speed signs, some Swedish and some German ones. It shows how the signs are specified in terms of the country code, type, subtype and value attributes.

It also shows how to specify the 3D model using the `name` attribute: If filename composed by country, type, subtype and value is not found, the `name` attribute + ".osgb" will be used for a second and final attempt.

[discrete]
===== Strings

From v2.35.0 string concatenation is supported. Whenever a string is detected that is netiher an opeator nor a function, the complete expression is treated as a string and '+' (plus) operator will merge surrounding evaluated strings which also can be evaluated parameters.

This can be useful when running permutations of scenarios, where names of actors or storyboard elements can be made unique by including parameters values.

Examples:

`${Event_overtake_ + $ActorName}` -> `Event_overtake_Target4`

`${Event_change_speed_to_ + $Speed}` -> `Event_change_speed_to_110`

=== Parameter distributions

Parameter values and distributions can be specified in a separate https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/09_reuse_mechanisms/09_03_parameter_distribution.html[Parameter value distribution file]. This is a convenient way of running multiple variations, or parameter value permutations, of a single scenario.

Here's an example: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc[cut-in_parameter_set.xosc].

To run all permutations with esmini, the following variants works:

. `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc`
. `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --param_dist ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc`
. `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --param_dist ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc`

The first two will use the scenario file referred to by the https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/ParameterValueDistribution.html[ParameterValueDistriution element] inside the parameter value distribution file (`cut-in_parameter_set.xosc`). The third example will apply the parameter settings on the scenario defined by the `osc` launch argument, overriding any scenario reference in the specified `param_dist` file. This can be useful when a single parameter distribution applies to multiple scenarios (instead of having one parameter file for each scenario).

How to abort:

`"ESC"` (in window) will terminate current run +
`"Ctrl-C"` (in terminal) will terminate all runs

The log files are now named according to:
`log_<permutation>_of_<total#permutations>.txt`

For example:

`log_1_of_12.txt` relates to the 1:th run of 12, permutation index 0 +
`log_4_of_12.txt` relates to the 4:th run of 12, permutation index 3

Of course this will apply also to custom log filenames. Example:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --logfile_path my_scenario.txt`

will output `my_scenario_1_of_12.txt`, `my_scenario_2_of_12.txt` ...

Also any recording (.dat), osi and csv files will be named in similar way. Example:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --record sim.dat --osi_file gt.osi --csv_logger data_log.csv`

will output complete sets of files: +
`log_1_of_12.txt` ... +
`sim_1_of_12.dat` ... +
`gt_1_of_12.osi` ... +
`data_log_1_of_12.csv` ...

To run a specific permutation only, specify index like this:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --param_permutation 2`

will run 3:rd permutation (of 12 available in this case)

Save the resulting OpenSCENARIO file with populated parameter values:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --save_xosc`

will output all twelve scenarios `cut-in_1_of_12.xosc` ...

To just save the scenario files quickly without executing them, add optional `quit` argument to the `save_osc` option, like this:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --save_xosc quit`

To view all results in parallel, make use of replayer like this:

`./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --record sim.dat ; ./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources/ --file sim_ --dir .`

.View all permutations in parallel
image::param_dist0.jpg[]

==== Parallel execution

Making use of Python threading pool framework we can utilize any multiple CPU kernels and run scenario variants in parallel. This is handled by the script https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/run_distribution.py[scripts/run_distribution.py].

Usage: `run_distribution.py <esmini args>`

Make sure to add at least the following esmini arguments: +
`--osc <parameter distribution file>` +
`--fixed_timestep <timestep>` +
`--headless`

Example:

`python ./scripts/run_distribution.py --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --headless --record sim.dat`

Of course, the --headless (and --fixed_timestep) is not required. It is possible to run with viewer as well:

`python ./scripts/run_distribution.py --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --window 60 60 800 400`

but the windows will open on top of each other at the same location on the screen, so you need to manually move them apart to see the parallel runs. Anyway, this use case is probably not relevant so the recommendation is to run headless with fixed time step.

Putting it all together, execute the scenario permutations in parallel and then view the result in replayer:

`python ./scripts/run_distribution.py --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --headless --record sim.dat ; ./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources/ --file sim_ --dir .`

==== Finding out number of permutations

To find out the number of permutations of a specific scenario and parameter distribution, use the `--return_nr_permutations` launch argument. Example:

`./bin/esmini --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_parameter_set.xosc --return_nr_permutations`

Output:
`Nr permutations: 12`

For scripters: esmini will also return the number of permutations as exit code, for simple use in scripts.
After executing the above the exit code can be inspected/verified from shell as well:

PowerShell: +
`echo $LastExitCode`  +
`6`

bash: +
`echo $?` +
`6`

=== Trajectories

Using OpenSCENARIO https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/FollowTrajectoryAction.html[FollowTrajectoryAction] you can define various types of trajectories for entities to follow.

esmini supports all three (as of OpenSCENARIO 1.2) https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/Shape.html[shapes]:

- polyline
- clothoid
- nurbs

Here follows a few design choices for the polyline type that affect the behavior.

When FollowMode is `follow` esmini will:

. Calculate heading based on direction of the line segments. However corners are interpolated in order to look better and avoid discontinuities.
. Calculate speed based on current speed (when action is triggered) and then with constant acceleration per segment reach destination vertex on time (or earlier if distance is too short vs time). This approach results in a continuous speed profile.

When FollowMode is `position` esmini will:

. For world coordinates, apply whatever heading is specified in the vertices (note that 0.0 is default). Lane and road coordinates will align to road direction as default.
. For each segment, calculate constant speed needed to reach next vertex on time. This approach results in a discontinuous speed profile.

==== Trajectory moving and driving direction

The driving direction and entity direction can be controlled by trajectory configuration combined with entity speed and heading. It's possible to follow trajectory in opposite direction and also to drive forward or reverse along the trajectory. The table below lists some combinations and possibilities.

[horizontal]
*input heading*:: explicit heading (optionally supported by some shape types) in trajectory control points pointing forward (-90 < heading < 90 deg along trajectory s axis) or backwards. `n/a`: not supported, `-`: not specified.
*timestamps*:: `n/a`: not supported, `-` not specified or timeReference is None, `yes`: specified timestamp and timeReference != None
*speed*:: `>0`: speed >= 0, `<0`: speed < 0. For timestamp mode, the magnitude of speed and overall motion direction is given by trajectory control point's timestamps and heading. Allowing for reversing, the initial heading of the entity, if specified, affects whether speed is positive (driving forward) or negative (reversing), see line 8 and 11.
*output heading*:: Entity heading relative trajectory s-axis direction (heading/tangent). `no change`: not affected by the action, `forward`: facing along s, `backward`: facing away from s. When not specified, entity heading will be aligned forward or backward according to the speed direction. Interpolation will be applied based on specified followingMode, see previous section.
*moving direction*:: entity motion along trajectory s-axis or opposite direction, given by: `sign(speed) * sign(entity heading rel. traj)`
*entity (in tc)*:: Corresponding entity in the smoke test scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/trajectory_speed.xosc[trajectory_speed.xosc], which checks the various trajectory configurations. See also videoclip below.

===== Trajectory motion direction control option
The influence from entity heading on the moving direction can be disabled by setting the global `ignore_heading_for_traj_motion` option, or setting the per Vehicle property    `ignoreHeadingForTrajMotion`="true". That will allow for entities facing away from and still move along the trajectory s-direction forward or backward according to specified speed alone. Line 9 and 10 above would result in:

`./bin/esmini --path ./resources/models --osc ./EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/traj_use_cases.xosc --custom_fixed_camera 24,27,28,5.5,0.57`

=== Friction

From v2.37.0 esmini supports road friction defined in https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/11_lanes/11_07_lane_properties.html#sec-8345bf25-d584-4a5b-8fa7-e15c920ab219[OpenDRIVE lane material].

Each lane within a lane section can have one or multiple segments of individual friction values, specified by s-value and friction coefficient.

Default friction coefficient is 1.0 as of v2.37.0, but might change in later versions. Lower friction (<1.0, slippery) will be visualized as bluish color. The lower friction, the more blue color. High friction values (>1.0,  "grippy") is indicated by redish color.

The friction is calculated per wheel. The values are reported in OSI ground-truth.

Example road: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xodr/straight_highway_500m.xodr[straight_highway_500m.xodr] (used by test scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/friction_and_lane_change_edge_case.xosc[friction_and_lane_change_edge_case.xosc])

=== SUMO integration

https://eclipse.dev/sumo/[SUMO] is a great open source traffic simulation tool. It has been integrated with esmini, making it possible to run SUMO simulations in esmini, and even mix or co-simulate SUMO vehicles with OpenSCENARIO vehicles.

*NOTE:* Even though SUMO has been linked with esmini for quite long, it's on a experimental level and has not been used a lot. Hence, expect shortcomings and issues. The currently integrated SUMO version, as of esmini v2.37.1, is 1.6.0 while the current SUMO version is 1.19.0. There is plans to update SUMO version in esmini in a soon future.

This chapter explains how to create a SUMO simulation and then how to use it in esmini. For just using SUMO simulations there is no need to install SUMO, it is already embedded with esmini (as long as it has not been explicitly excluded, see <<Slim esmini - customize configration>>). Only to create SUMO content it has to be installed.

==== Install SUMO

1. Get SUMO from here: https://eclipse.dev/sumo/
2. Install normally, check any option to add sumo to environment path variable

==== Try example from esmini

. Launch `sumo-gui` application
. File -> Open Simulation
. Navigate to `esmini/resources/sumo_inputs` and select `multi_intersections.sumocfg`
. Set Delay (ms) to 100, otherwise simulation will run super-quick
. Run (Play button or Simulation -> Run)

==== Running the same scenario in esmini

. In a terminal, from esmini root folder, run:
. `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/sumo-test.xosc`

==== Create a SUMO simulation

First, there is a great complete guide at https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/

The main flow of our example is:

. Convert an OpenDRIVE file into a SUMO road network
. Identify some trips (start and end points) within the road network
. From the trips, resolve complete routes wthich are assigned to vehicles and distribute over time
. Create a configuration referring to the road network and route definition

Step-by-step:

. Create a new folder, e.g. "my_sumo", for this example
. Copy esmini/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xodr/simple_3way_motorway.xodr into the new folder
. Open a terminal in the new folder
. Convert the xodr into a SUMO https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Networks/SUMO_Road_Networks.html[road network]: +
   `netconvert --opendrive fabriksgatan.xodr -o my_sumo.net.xml`
. Create some traffic using https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tools/Trip.html#randomtripspy[randomTrips.py] (and https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/duarouter.html[duarouter]): +
    `randomTrips.py -n my_sumo.net.xml -e 60 -o my_sumo.trips.xml --route-file my_sumo.rou.xml`
+
If this fails, it may be because of lacking .py file association. Try:
+
```
python3 randomTrips.py ...
python randomTrips.py ...
python3 tools/randomTrips.py ...
python tools/randomTrips.py ...
```

[start=6]
. Create the configuration file
+
Save the following lines into a new file named "my_sumo.sumocfg":
+
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<configuration>
    <input>
        <net-file value="my_sumo.net.xml"/>
        <route-files value="my_sumo.rou.xml"/>
    </input>
    <time>
        <begin value="0"/>
        <end value="60"/>
        <step-length value="0.01"/>
    </time>
</configuration>
----

. Open Sumo, load the created config file "my_sumo.sumocfg" and run as in first example, <<Try example from esmini>>.

==== Connect a SUMO simulation to a scenario in esmini

Currently, as of esmini v2.37.1, SUMO is integrated in terms of a controller. To add a SUMO simulation, define an entity as usual, assign the SumoController and set its "filepath" property to the sumocfg file.

Now when we have a complete SUMO configuration, do the following steps in order to use it in esmini:

. Copy the three files: my_sumo.net.xml, my_sumo.rou.xml and my_sumo.sumocfg (roadnetwork, routes, config) to `esmini/resources/sumo_inputs`

. Create a file named "my_sumo.xosc", in `esmini/resources/xosc` with the following content:
+

== Positioning

esmini supports all OpenSCENARIO position types. To support various use cases esmini add some mechanisms and interpretations:

- *Align by omit*: Lacking position component values (x, y, z, heading, pitch, roll) in the scenario file is interpreted as "please align this component to the road surface". E.g. missing z value will project the position on the road surface, missing pitch value will ensure object is aligned with road pitch (e.g. up- and downhill).

- *PositionMode*: Any position/object can be set and configured with respect to alignment via API calls. For example: x, y and heading can be set as absolute values while pitch and roll can be set as relative to the road surface.

See more details below in <<Position modes>>

- *Trajectory interpolation*: Based omitted position components and followingMode setting esmini will apply different mechanisms to follow and interpolate trajectory vertices/control points.

See details below in <<Trajectory interpolation and alignment>>

=== Position modes

The purpose of position modes is to allow flexible and detailed control whether to interpret Z (elevation), heading, pitch and roll as absolute values or relative to the road. X and Y will always be interpreted as absolute values.

For some use cases orientation should be aligned to road surface, e.g. a vehicle simply driving along a hilly road. In some cases pitch and roll should be zero, e.g. signs and buildings along the road. External vehicle models can choose whether to report relative or absolute values. It can also be combination, e.g. explicit/absolute heading while z, roll and pitch are realative (to the road) - or any other combination.

The mode can be specified explicitly when calling a set position function. Example:

`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_ABS | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL);`

In above example x, y, and h will be interpretated as absolute values while z, p, and r as relative to the road.

==== Persistent mode setting

In most cases the same mode setting will be used throughout the simulation for each object. For this reason, as conveience, the mode can be set once per object. Example:

`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::SET, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_ABS | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL);`

Then, when calling set functions, mode can be set to zero. Example:

`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 0);`

or use the simple variants skipping the mode argument. Example:

`pos.SetInertiaPos(x, y, z, h, p, r);`

These cases will utilize the current setting.

==== Two types of settings

Note the type=SET argument of the SetMode() example above. It specifies as to which type of operations the settings applies to. There are two types of modes: SET and UPDATE. SET applies to API calls setting Cartesian coordinates. UPDATE applies to position updates by default controller and API calls setting Lane and Road coordinates.

This way a position object can, for example, maintain relative heading follow the curvature of the road when updated by the default controller, while heading can be set explicitly in terms of absolute value by API calls.

`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::UPDATE, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_REL | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL);`

`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::SET, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_ABS | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL);`

==== Default values

There will be a default setting for both SET and UPDATE which will be applied until changed by SetMode() function:

[horizontal]
*SET*:: PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_ABS | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL
*UPDATE*:: PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_REL | PosMode::P_REL | PosMode::R_REL

*Further examples*

Specify only mode for Z, reuse whatever setting for the remaining components:

`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, PosMode::Z_ABS);`

Set/reset default value for pitch, reuse whatever setting for the other components:

`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, PosMode::Z_MASK & PosMode::Z_DEF);`

=== Mode specification

Mode is coded in four chunks of three bits. One chunk for each of the position components Z, Heading, Pitch and Roll. Chunks are padded and aligned to segments of four bytes.

Looking up values in the table above, modes can be specified in numerous ways.

For example: To set world position with relative Z and absolute Pitch, reusing setting for the other components, any of the following identical examples will work:

`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::P_ABS);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 0x7 | 0x300);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 0x307);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 0x0307);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 7 | 768);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 7 + 768);` +
= +
`pos.SetInertiaPosMode(x, y, z, h, p, r, 775);`

==== Use cases

1. Simple 2D vehicle model. Report only X, Y and Heading. Align Z, pitch and roll to the road surface:
`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::SET, PosMode::H_ABS);` +
`pos.SetInertiaPos(x, y, 0.0, h, 0.0, 0.0);` +
or use short version of the same function, applying zero to z, p, r: +
`pos.SetInertiaPos(x, y, h);` +

2. Advanced 3D vehicle model. Report all 6 DOF: X, Y, Z, Heading, Pitch and Roll. I.e. no explicit alignment to road surface:
`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::SET, PosMode::Z_ABS | PosMode::H_ABS | PosMode::P_ABS | PosMode::R_ABS);` +
`pos.SetInertiaPos(x, y, 0.0, h, 0.0, 0.0);` +
or use short version of the same function, applying zero to z, p, r: +
`pos.SetInertiaPos(x, y, h);` +

3. Rotate a pedestrian 90 degree left to move forward facing the road driving direction, as on a hoverboard: +
`pos.SetHeadingRelative(1.5708);` +
`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::UPDATE, PosMode::H_REL);` +
Default controller will now move the pedestrian along the road but rotated 90 degree.

4. Put pedestrian on a hoverboard moving sideways forward (heading=90 degrees) along the road, 1 meter above ground: +
`pos.SetHeadingRelative(1.57);` +
`pos.SetZRelative(1.0);` +
`pos.SetMode(Position::PosModeType::UPDATE, PosMode::Z_REL | PosMode::H_REL);` +
Default controller will now move the pedestrian along the road 1 meter above ground, with maintained heading relative to the road.

=== Trajectory interpolation and alignment

For convenience, esmini can calculate heading and align to the tangent of each segment (polyline and NURBS). Further, to smoothen motion esmini can interpolate corners of polyline trajectories. The behavior is based on omitted position components and `followingMode` settings.

In general specified angles (heading, pitch and roll) will be interpolated over the segment between two vertices/control points. However, in many cases it's prefered to just align heading with the tangent of the curve. For these cases it should not be necessary to specify the angles, but rather have esmini calculate them.

First, when z value is missing, i.e. elevation is not specified, esmini will project the points to the road surface. Availability of z will also affect alignment of orientation. General rule is that ground trajectories (elevation not specified) will align pitch and roll to the road surface, while these components will be set to zero for floating (specified z values) trajectories.

Missing angles will be handled according to the table below:

[%autowidth, cols="1,1,1"]
|===
||Input|Result
|*missing angle component*|*z specified?*|*align orientation to*
|heading|Yes|trajectory
|heading|No|trajectory
|pitch|Yes|trajectory
|pitch|No|road surface
|roll|Yes|0.0
|roll|No|road surface
|===

While moving along polylines, which tangent is not continuous, it's usually preferred to interpolate/smoothen orientation along whole linear segments or at least when passing vertex corners.

The table below shows what interpolation method will be applied, as default, based on FollowingMode setting for the trajectory:

[%autowidth, cols="2,2"]
|===
|*FollowingMode*|*Interpolate mode*
|position|corner
|follow|segment
|===

The interpolation mode can be explicitly set, or even disabled altogether:

* option: `pline_interpolation <mode>` (see also esmini <<Launch commands>>)
* vehicle property: `plineInterpolation <mode>`

Valid modes: `segment`, `corner`, `off`

*Note:* The option is global, i.e. affects all trajectories, while vehicle property is per entity. Option has precedence, so any vehicle property will be ignored if the option is set.

=== Example
There is a code and scenario example illustrating the various interpolation and position modes:

https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/position-mode

Video clip:

video::87TbahvpLBM[youtube,width=854,height=480,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

This specific example includes four objects:

1. Pedestrian/skater on the road +
Initially it's standing still, aligned along the road x-axis (relative heading = 0).

2. Box2 moving along a NURBS trajectory +
Specified z will make it "floating" (not projected on ground). Omitted heading will have esmini calculate heading along the tangent.

3. Box3 moving along another NURBS trajectory +
Also floating. Demonstrating specified roll will be interpolated between control points.

4. Box1 moving along a polyline trajectory +
followingMode = position will make smoothly transitions at vertex corners.

The application will control and report the motion for the skater. At 5 seconds it will rotate 90 degree and move this way along the road, like riding a hoverboard. Then at 15 seconds it will move one meter up from road surface (z=1 relative road) and also rotate back 90 degrees (heading=0 relative road) and move this way along the road, like on a flyboard. During the complete scenario pitch and roll is set to 0 (absolute value - not aligned to road).

=== Relative positions and routes

For the OpenSCENARIO `RelativeRoadPosition` and `RelativeLanePosition` the `ds` and `dsLane` attributes specifies an offset along the s-axis of the road and lane respectively. In case the offset results in a s-value outside the boundary of the current road, the target location will be searched via connected roads and lanes, even through junctions.

In case the action object (the one being positioned) has been assigned a route, the route will be respected, i.e. the target location will be along the route. If the action object lacks a route, any route of the referenced entity will be respected instead. If neither objects has a route assigned the default routing rules will apply.

In the image below two cars, red and blue, are being positioned by means of `RelativeRoadPosition` or `RelativeLanePosition` with the white car as the reference entity. They have both the same `ds` value, i.e. same longitudinal distance (along s-axis) from the white car. Since the red car has an assigned route, it ends up along that route. The blue car, lacking a route, will end up along the route of the referenced white car.

=== Reference line and center lane

image::lane_offset_standard_way.png[]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2B1_road[2+1 roads] can be defined utilizing lane offset:

image::lane_offset_two_plus_one.jpg[]

`lane id` relates to reference lane. `lane offset` relates to the current lane. `t` relates to reference line.
[%autowidth, options=header]
|===
||white car|red car
|*lane id*|-2|-1
|*lane offset*|0.0|0.0
|*t*|-1.75|1.75

A 2+1 example example scenario is found here: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/two_plus_one_road.xosc[resources/xosc/two_plus_one_road.xosc]

*Note*: In esmini versions prior to 2.43 the reference line was incorrectly affected by lane offset as well. The `t`-values in the table then became -5.25 for the white car and -1.75 for the red car.

== Controllers

=== Controller concept
OpenSCENARIO provides the controller concept as a way to outsource control the motion and appearance of scenario entities. For the OpenSCENARIO description of the controller concept, see https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=4908&token=ae9d9b44ab9257e817072a653b5d5e98ee0babf8#_controllers[OpenSCENARIO User Guide].

Controllers can be assigned to object of type Vehicle or Pedestrian. Once assigned, controllers are activated for a given domain (e.g longitudinal, lateral, Lighting, Animation) using the ActivateControllerAction. It's also possible to activate immediately as part of the AssignControllerAction.

While the ActivateControllerAction is executing, the Controller assigned to that object will manage specified domain(s). Controllers may be internal (part of the simulator) or external (defined in another file).

Intended use cases for Controllers include: +
- Specifying that a vehicle is controlled by the system under test.
- Defining smart actor behavior, where a controller takes intelligent decisions in response to the road network or other actors. Hence, controllers can be used, for example, to make agents in a scenario behave in a human-like way.
- Assigning a vehicle to direct human control.

The Controller element contains Properties, which can be used to specify controller behavior either directly or by a file reference.

Although OpenSCENARIO from v1.2 supports assignment of multiple controllers to an object, esmini is currently only supporting one controller to be assigned (and hence activated) to an object at the time.

=== Background and motivation
esmini version < 2.0 totally lacked support for controllers. Instead some similar functionality were implemented as part of different example-applications. For example, EgoSimulator provided interactive control of one vehicle. There was also an "external" mode which allowed for an external vehicle simulator to report current position for the typical Ego (VUT/SUT...) vehicle.

First, this approach made the example code of simple applications complex. Secondly, it limited the use cases of esmini since functionality was tightly embedded in the applications.

Controllers provides a much more flexible way of adding functionality to esmini, in a way harmonizing with the standard (OpenSCENARIO 1.X). A side effect of this "outsourcing" of functionality is that the former demo applications could be reduced to a minimum both in number and size.

=== Brief on implementation

Controllers was introduced in esmini v2.0. Briefly it works as follows:

There is a collection of embedded controllers coming with esmini. Each controller inherit from the base class Controller (Controller.h/cpp). In order for esmini to be aware of the existence of a controller it has to be registered. This is done through the ScenarioReader method https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/3d1abcd6b3e3855707dc424f7c25477bbf136078/EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/ScenarioEngine/SourceFiles/ScenarioReader.hpp#L132[`RegisterController`]. It will put the controller into a collection to have available when the scenario is being parsed. So all controllers need to be registered prior to loading the scenario.

A controller is registered with the following information:

. Its static name which is used as identifier.
. A pointer to a function instantiating the controller.

This architecture makes it possible for an external module to create a controller and registering it without modifying any of esmini modules. In that way it is a semi-plugin concept, you can say.

*Note*: Even though ScenarioReader have a helper function for registering all the embedded controllers the RegisterController can be called from any module directly, at any time prior to scenario initialization.

esmini catalog framework supports controllers as well, so controllers can be defined in catalogs as presets, just like vehicles and routes for example.

=== How it works for the user

Controllers are completely handled in the OpenSCENARIO file. With one exception: esmini provides the --disable-controllers option which totally ignore any controllers, just performing the scenario with DefaultControllers, which can be handy when previewing and debugging scenarios.

In terms of OpenSCENARIO a controller is assigned to an entity (object) in any of two ways:

. As part of the Entities section and ScenarioObject definition, using the ObjectController element.
. The AssignControllerAction which can be triggered as any action at any time during the simulation.

Once assigned the controller must finally be activated using the ActivateControllerAction which can be triggered at any time. It provides an attribute to specify which domain(s) to control: Lateral, Longitudinal or both.

Example 1: Implicit assignment of controller using the `ObjectController` element:

[source,xml]
----
<Entities>
   <ScenarioObject name="Ego">
     <CatalogReference catalogName="VehicleCatalog" entryName="$HostVehicle"/>
      <ObjectController>
          <Controller name="MyController" >
             <Properties>
                 <Property name="esminiController" value="InteractiveController" />
                 <Property name="speedFactor" value="1.5" />
             </Properties>
          </Controller>
      </ObjectController>
   </ScenarioObject>
</Entities>
----

Example 2: As above, but using catalog reference:

[source,xml]
----
<Entities>
   <ScenarioObject name="Ego">
     <CatalogReference catalogName="VehicleCatalog" entryName="$HostVehicle"/>
        <ObjectController>
            <CatalogReference catalogName="ControllerCatalog" entryName="interactiveDriver" />
        </ObjectController>
   </ScenarioObject>
</Entities>
----


Example 3: Activate controller in the `Init` section:

[source,xml]
----
<Init>
   <Actions>
      <Private entityRef="Ego">
         <PrivateAction>
            <TeleportAction>
               <Position>
                  <LanePosition roadId="0" laneId="-3" offset="0" s="$EgoStartS"/>
               </Position>
            </TeleportAction>
         </PrivateAction>
         <PrivateAction>
              <ActivateControllerAction longitudinal="true" lateral="true" />
         </PrivateAction>
      </Private>
   </Actions>
</Init>
----

Example 4: Assign and activate the controller in the `Storyboard` section:

[source,xml]
----
<Event name="InteractiveEvent" maximumExecutionCount="1" priority="overwrite">
   <Action name="AssignControllerAction">
     <PrivateAction>
          <ControllerAction>
              <AssignControllerAction>
                  <CatalogReference catalogName="ControllerCatalog" entryName="interactiveDriver" />
              </AssignControllerAction>
          </ControllerAction>
      </PrivateAction>
   </Action>
   <Action name="ActivateControllerAction">
      <PrivateAction>
          <ControllerAction>
              <ActivateControllerAction longitudinal="true" lateral="true" />
          </ControllerAction>
      </PrivateAction>
   </Action>
   <StartTrigger>
      <ConditionGroup>
         <Condition name="" delay="0" conditionEdge="none">
            <ByValueCondition>
               <SimulationTimeCondition value="20" rule="greaterThan"/>
            </ByValueCondition>
         </Condition>
      </ConditionGroup>
   </StartTrigger>
</Event>
----

To disable any controller simply apply ActivateControllerAction on no domain, like:

[source,xml]
----
<ActivateControllerAction longitudinal="false" lateral="false" />
----
That should work in all OpenSCENARIO supporting tools. In esmini you can also assign `DefaultController` which will disconnect any assigned controller.

=== The ghost concept

The purpose of the ghost concept is to support external driver models. The idea is to launch a forerunner, which performs the maneuvers in the OSC file. The resulting trajectory (also called trail), including speed and heading info, is registered. The driver model can then use the ghost trail as guidance. More specifically, the driver model can probe the trail at any timestamp or distance from its current pos and use the result for both steering and speed target.

image::ghost_concept1.png[]

A typical use case is having an external Ego vehicle simulator, including System Under test (SUT) and a driver model. Instead of the driver model (in the external simulator) being aware of and execute scenario maneuvers it can hand over to esmini to play the maneuvers and then simply try to mimic it, following in ghost's trail. This way the external simulator can benefit from esmini scenario engine and just concentrate on following the ghost.

The ghost feature is available in the following esmini embedded controllers:

* <<FollowGhost>>
* <<ExternalController>>

There are two different methods to probe the ghost trail:

. By time: Ask for ghost state (pos, heading, speed...) at specific timestamp
. By distance: Ask for ghost state at a specific distance, from a position (typically current Ego position)

Both methods will return a RoadInfo structure including position details e.g. world position (absolute and relative Ego), road coordinates, road pitch, trail heading, heading angle to the target point and ghost speed at that point.

[source,xml]
----
include::{src-local-root}/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp[tag=SE_RoadInfo_struct]
----

[discrete]
==== Time method
This approach is trivial, it will give the state of ghost at the specified timestamp using the API call:

https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/362bcae28253f4eef2778e6f11b7a8393e6a3cd4/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L815[int SE_GetRoadInfoGhostTrailTime(int object_id, float time, SE_RoadInfo* data, float* speed_ghost);]

[discrete]
==== Distance method

The API call is:

https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/362bcae28253f4eef2778e6f11b7a8393e6a3cd4/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L805[int SE_GetRoadInfoAlongGhostTrail(int object_id, float lookahead_distance, SE_RoadInfo *data, float *speed_ghost);]


The method needs some further explanation. The basic idea is to look specified distance along the ghost trail and receive information at that target point. The tricky part is where to start measuring the distance from. This is how it works:

image::ghost_concept2.png[]

. From Ego, find closest point on trail (blue point)
. From that point, look forward x meters along trail (red dot)
. Get info from that ”target” point

Ideally, two points are used: One closer for target speed and one more distant for steering target.

.Different lookahead for speed and steering control
image::ghost_targets.jpg[]

Tuning parameters:

. Lookahead distance along trail
  * Typically speed dependent (look further at higher speeds)
  * Potentially decrease distance with increased curvature (to stay on road)
. Headstart time
 * As small as possible, but enough for required lookahead distance

[Note]
====
*Note:*
If lookahead distance is too large, the steering target angle becomes irrelevant, leading to driving off road
====

.Too large lookahead distance
image::ghost_concept3.png[]
[discrete]
==== Actions and triggers

Most actions that affects motion will be transferred from the original entity (Ego) to its ghost, for example: `SpeedAction`, `LaneChangeAction` and `TeleportAction`. In addition, triggers will be affected in the following ways:

* Entity triggers: Replace any occurrence of original entity with ghost in the list of `TriggeringEntities`. For example, if the vehicle should brake when reaching a specified position, then it's the ghost that should trigger the action - not the original entity.
* Other triggers: Restart ghost from where the Ego is now, in effect rewind ghost `headStartTime` seconds and recreate trajectory from there. The purpose is to enable ghost to react on triggers that happens in the "real" scenario (which plays out `headStartTime` seconds behind the ghost)
* `SimulationTime` trigger conditions for events where Ego is the actor will be adjusted wrt ghost `headStartTime` time. For example, if vehicle should brake after 20 seconds of driving (simulationTime = 20), then it will be changed to simulationTime = 17 (for headstart 3s), since the ghost has been driving for 20 seconds at that point.

[discrete]
===== Examples

The following examples shows two different triggers for a lane change action. First example uses TraveledDistanceCondition. Ghost will be the triggering entity and since this is independent of other road users, there is no need to restart ghost.

The second example, on the other hand, uses TimeHeadwayCondition which calculates the time gap between the white Ego car and the red Target car, hence depending on other road users. Since ghost is running ahead of time it does not make sense to involve ghost in such conditions, hence Ego will be the triggering entity.

Example 1: Trigger based on traveled distance - no restart

    </EntityCondition>
</ByEntityCondition>

Note that the strategy results in desired behavior in probably the majority of cases, but not all. There might be exceptions where another behavior is expected or required. The manipulation described above is handled by the methods `SetupGhost()` and `ReplaceObjectInTrigger()` in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/ScenarioEngine/SourceFiles/ScenarioEngine.cpp[ScenarioEngine.cpp] which can be modified to fit custom needs.

[discrete]
==== Controllers and ghost

OpenSCENARIO 1.2 onwards supports multiple assigned controllers. All except the first controller will be handed over to the ghost. Hence make sure to put the ghost controller first, since it will stick to the "Ego".

Example scenario, where ghost is utilizing the followRoute controller: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/follow_route_ghost_starting_on_route.xosc[follow_route_ghost_starting_on_route.xosc].

[discrete]
==== Additional notes on using the ghost feature

Timestamps in log are always of same reference. Whenever a ghost is involved the time will start at -`headStartTime`, in order for the actual scenario to start at simulationTime = 0. Example: Assuming `headStartTime = 3s`, a log message for an Ego action like:

`-2.100: SpeedChange standbyState -> startTransition -> runningState`

means that action SpeedChange (Ego action that has been moved to ghost) is performed 0.9 (-2.1 + 3) seconds after ghost was launched. This would, for example, be the case for a `simulationTime = 0.9` condition.

=== esmini embedded controllers

Below is a listing of some of the available controllers in esmini. Note that only DefaultController is related to the OpenSCENARIO standard. The other ones are esmini-specific and will not work in other tools (so far there is no standard plugin-architecture for controllers to enable moving between tools). For updated and complete definition of controllers and their parameters, see https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/Catalogs/Controllers/ControllerCatalog.xosc[ControllerCatalog.xosc].

==== DefaultController
Performs actions exactly as specified in the OpenSCENARIO file. Assigned to entities by default. Can be assigned at any point to "unassign" any currently assigned controller. +

==== FollowGhost
A simple driver model. A ghost-twin performing the events a few seconds ahead. The entity will then do its best to mimic the motion and speed of the ghost by follow the trajectory. The primary purpose of this controller is to provide an example, but it can be useful to smoothen out the sometimes synthetic feel of pure default controller. +

==== ExternalController
The entity will not be moved by the scenario. Instead its state (position, rotation ...) is expected to be reported from external simulator via API, e.g. SE_ReportObjectPos. Ghost trajectory can optionally be created for an external driver model to use as reference. +

==== SumoController
A way of integrating SUMO controlled vehicles in a scenario. OpenSCENARIO vehicles are reported to SUMO, and SUMO vehicles are reported back to esmini. A reference to a SUMO config file is provided as input to the controller. See cut-in_sumo.xosc for an example.

===== Example usage

Run example alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc`

Change model:

* Open `resources/xosc/alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc` in a text editor
* In the ALKS_R157SM_Controller, change +
`<Property name="model" value="Regulation"/>` to +
`<Property name="model" value="ReferenceDriver"/>`
* Save and run again: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc`

You can hardly see any difference. Let's run the two variants again and record for post analysis.

* Set model to "ReferenceDriver" (by edit the file as described above)
* Run: +
`./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.02 --osc ./resources/xosc/alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc --record sim-ref.dat`
* Set model to "Regulation"
* Run: +
`./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.02 --osc ./resources/xosc/alks_r157_cut_in_quick_brake.xosc --record sim-reg.dat`
* View scenarios in parallel: +
`./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --dir . --file sim- --view_mode boundingbox`
* Create a merged .dat file and plot it: +
`./bin/replayer --file sim- --dir . --save_merged sim_merged.dat` +
`./scripts/plot_dat.py --param speed sim_merged.dat`

Something like this should show:

image::plot_merged_alks_ex.png[]

Of course you can run also FSM and RSS models in similar way and merge all four .dat files. For more information about `replayer`, see "Plot merged .dat files" example in <<Plot scenario data>> section.

==== FollowRoute

Implementation of the Lane Independent Routing Model (LIRM) developed as part of the master thesis project https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12380/305133[Olsson, Daniel; Rylander, Eric: "A Framework for Verification and
Validation of Simulation Models in esmini"].

From the https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstream/20.500.12380/305133/1/CSE%2022-59%20Olsson%20Rylander.pdf[report]: "LIRM has solved the issue with lane dependent routing that esmini had, by implementing a new controller that extends the behavior of the pathfinding and route following to incorporate lane changes."

This controller enhance the capabilities for an entity to find a path through the road network according to a specified https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/Route.html[route] (basically a set of waypoints). The main advantage, compared to the route handler of the default controller, is that lane changes will be injected by the path finding algorithm in search for optimal path. The model will also take route strategy (Shortest, Fastest or Least Intersections) into consideration, which the default controller does not yet support.

A good example is found in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/follow_route_with_lane_change.xosc[follow_route_with_lane_change.xosc]. The vehicle start out in left-most lane and needs to make three lane changes in order to exit the highway.

==== UDPDriverController

An UDP interface for external driver models or vehicle simulators. The idea is to allow external devices to control entities in an ongoing esmini simulation, over network.

Concept:

image::udp_driver_controller_concept.png[]

* Assign the controller to any scenario vehicle (in the OpenSCENARIO file)
* Send input to esmini controller
* The vehicle will be updated by the controller accordingly (and bypassing esmini default controller)
* receive ground-truth (OSI over UDP) from esmini


There are a few input mode options:

1. DRIVER_INPUT +
Control a simple vehicle model in terms of pedals and steering input. Vehicle will apply latest received values until update is received.
[horizontal]
Parameters: ::
  `throttle` +
  `brake` +
  `steeringAngle`

2. VEHICLE_STATE_XYZHPR +
Report explicit complete state, ignoring road geometry. Useful when advanced vehicle dynamics is involved and vehicle for example is pitching as result of acceleration and rolling as result of steering. Optional flag to enable dead reckoning on esmini side, in which case esmini will move entity according to latest received heading and speed (basically extrapolating).
[horizontal]
Parameters: ::
  `x` +
  `y` +
  `z` +
  `h`(eading) +
  `p`(itch) +
  `r`(oll) +
  `speed` +
  `wheelAngle` (wheel yaw/stering angle) +
  `deadReckon` (flag)

3. VEHICLE_STATE_XYH +
Report explicit partial state. `z`, `pitch` and `roll` are aligned to the road geometry.
[horizontal]
Parameters: ::
  `x` +
  `y` +
  `h`(eading) +
  `speed` +
  `wheelAngle` (wheel yaw/stering angle) +
  `deadReckon` (flag)

4. VEHICLE_STATE_H +
Minimal explicit state, useful when the driver model output is only heading and speed.
[horizontal]
Parameters: ::
  `h`(eading) +
  `speed` +
  `wheelAngle` (wheel yaw/stering angle) +
  `deadReckon` (flag)

For more info see: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qc2n7db0h9k7urt/UDPDriverController.pdf?dl=0[UDPDriverController.pdf]

Demo (running a somewhat outdated https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/udp_driver/testUDPDriver.py[testUDPDriver.py]):

==== OffroadFollowerController

A simple "follow-the-leader" controller which aims to keep a specified distance to a specified leading vehicle. The controller utilizes a simple 2D "bicycle" vehicle model. Each time-step the controller finds out the direction and distance to the lead vehicle. Based on this, the acceleration and steering input is calculated and provided to the vehicle model.

The term off-road indicates that the controller does not consider any road network features. Note that it still can run on roads, parking lots, just that it's ignoring it in terms of lanes and road-marks.

Below is a video clip showing the controller in action on an open paved area. The white lead vehicle is controlled interactively by the user via arrow keys. The controller is assigned to the red car which then strives to follow the lead car at the distance of 20 meters.

video::uHqdsORPsGE[youtube,width=854,height=480,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

==== NaturalDriverController

A controller designed to drive naturally on highways and urban roads, with a driver which tries to keep its desired lane, while keeping the distance to a target in front and, if the conditions are correct, will make a lane change to overtake a lead vehicle.

The desired lane for the controller vehicle is set with a parameter (named "Route"), the driver will strive to reach and maintain this lane. The driver will follow the car in front following the IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) logic, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model. The driver will change lane according to MOBIL (General Lane-Changing Model for Car-Following Models), https://mtreiber.de/publications/MOBIL_TRB.pdf. The lane changing doesn't take traffic density or ramps / junctions into account, and thus the model is only suitable on roads without such geomitries.

The model is fully parameterized to suit the desired need of each simulation. For all properties see `NaturalDriver` in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/Catalogs/Controllers/ControllerCatalog.xosc[Controllers/ControllerCatalog.xosc].

Example usage can be found in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/scenario_scripts/test_traffic.py

Demo (running scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/highway_driver.xosc):

===  How to add a new controller

Below are the steps to add new controller in esmini:

. Create a sepreate controller module in the controller folder. Suggestion is to copy one of the existing and use as a starting point.
. Register the controller in the LoadControllers() fuction in EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/ScenarioEngine/SourceFiles/ScenarioReader.cpp
. Create Instantiate method in the new controller. The name shall be unique eg InstantiateControllerLooming
. In the new controller, Type name shall be unique eg, CONTROLLER_LOOMING_TYPE_NAME
. Add controller type and it shall be unique in EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/Controllers/Controller.hpp

== OpenSceneGraph and 3D models

esmini make use of OpenSceneGraph (OSG) for visualization of the scenario. The OpenSCENARIO files can optionally refer to existing 3D models of the static environment (scene graph) and dynamic objects (entities). If the scene graph reference is missing, esmini will try to generate a basic model based on the OpenDRIVE road network description. Currently esmini only supports OSG native .osgb 3D file format. However, there are ways to convert 3D models as described next.

http://www.openscenegraph.org/[OpenSceneGraph] (osg) includes readers and writers for quite a few 3D file formats. It comes with a demo application, http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/user-guides/55-osgconv[osgconv], a command line tool that simply takes one file as input and outputs the same content in a different format.

Examples:

Convert from fbx to osgb format: +
`osgconv car.fbx car.osgb`

Convert from osgb to https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview[fbx] format: +
`osgconv car.osgb car.fbx`

osgconv has a lot of useful options. Run `osgconv -h` for more info. Here's a few examples:

``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb --compressed`` will compress and embed textures +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -t 1,5,7`` will translate the model (x=1, y=5, z=7) +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -o -90-1,0,0`` will rotate the model (rotate -90 deg around X-axis) +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -o -90-1,0,0 --use-world-frame`` as above but pivot point world origin +

A useful environment variable is `OSG_OPTIMIZER` which affects the structure and content of the scene graph. For example, if the osgb file includes cloned sub trees, like motorway railings, these might not be populated in the fbx file. To solve that set:

`OSG_OPTIMIZER = FLATTEN_STATIC_TRANSFORMS_DUPLICATING_SHARED_SUBGRAPHS`

Exact syntax depends on your environment. Examples:
[horizontal]
*bash*:: ``export OSG_OPTIMIZER=FLATTEN_STATIC_TRANSFORMS_DUPLICATING_SHARED_SUBGRAPHS``
*powershell*:: ``$env:OSG_OPTIMIZER = "FLATTEN_STATIC_TRANSFORMS_DUPLICATING_SHARED_SUBGRAPHS"``

Then run the ``osgconv`` command (in the same terminal where you defined the environment variable).

osg native format is `osgb` which stands for OpenSceneGraph binary format. It's a stable and compact (quick to load) format, which also can embed textures and animations. Thanks to the osgconv tool, esmini can get away with only supporting the .osgb format and still indirectly support many other 3D formats.

=== Get osgconv

There are pre-built binaries available, see below. But for full capabilities, including support for converting from 3D file formats .dae (collada) and .fbx (Autodesk Filmbox) you have to build OpenSceneGraph (osg) yourself.

==== Build yourself

===== Prerequisites
The only prerequisite step is for Linux to install some dependecies:

1. Run `software-properties-gtk` +
or open the "Software & Updates" application

2. then under the "Ubuntu Software" tab click "Source code" and add a server of your choice, e.g. within your country

3. Run `sudo apt-get build-dep openscenegraph`

Reference Step 1 & 2: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/614082

===== Build

You can then try this script: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/compile_osg_apps.sh[compile_osg_apps.sh]. It will first fetch and install https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0[FBX SDK] and then build OSG with FBX and DAE support. Find more details and instructions in the header of the script.

For more info regarding building OSG for Linux, here's a great guide: +
https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/osg-linux-quick-install/  +
But note that it does not consider FBX support.

Find more info on COLLADA via this old http://www.openscenegraph.com/index.php/documentation/guides/user-guides/111-collada[link].

==== Pre-build binaries

*Windows* +
Binaries including FBX but not DAE support, see here: +
https://objexx.com/OpenSceneGraph.html

*Linux* +

`sudo apt-get update` +
`sudo apt-get -y install openscenegraph`

Reference: https://installati.one/install-openscenegraph-ubuntu-20-04/?expand_article=1

=== Convert osgb models for use in Unity
Here follows an example of how to convert .osgb models into .fbx format for use in the Unity3D framework.

. Open a command prompt in the folder where your model.osgb is
. Run command: +
   `osgconv model.osgb out/model.fbx -s 100,100,100` +
   "-s ..." is for scaling which typically is needed for fbx files.
   Potentially it also needs to be oriented according to Unity coordinate system. In that case try: +
   `osgconv model.osgb out/model.fbx -s 100,100,100 --use-world-frame -o 120pass:[--]0.5773503,-0.5773503,-0.5773503`

A folder named "out" should have been created and including the model.fbx plus any texture files

=== Import into Unity
. Drag the resulting fbx file, and all textures, into a unity project, preferably an empty folder
. Add the model to the Scene hierarchy
. Select the model and int the "Inspector", select the "Materials" tab
. Change the "Location" to "Use External Materials (Legacy)" and click "Apply"
. Open the automatically created "Materials" folder (next to the model file)
. Select all materials and change +
   for standard template: "Rendering Mode" to "Cutout" (good default option)  +
   for HDRP template: "Surface type" to "Transparent" and check "alpha clipping"

That should basically be it.

=== Colors, textures and wheel rotations

See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/63#issuecomment-742273326[issue 63] for brief information on how to create vehicle 3D models with moving wheels.

And these two scripts operating on textures and material respectively, can potentially provide some inspiration: +
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/bake_signs.sh[bake_signs.sh] +
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/fix_dae_materials.py[fix_dae_materials.py]

=== Lighting

esmini use a very simple lighting model. Adding a global low ambient plus a stronger directed "sun" light. This is a simplistic model of a bright day where everything is visible but sides facing towards the sun gets brighter than those facing away.

The ambient intensity is 0.4. The "sun" x,y,z position is (-7500, 5000, 10000) and intensity 0.8.

Now, it has been reported that some custom models looks very dark on sides facing away from the sun. The main reason is often that the material definition do not have any ambient contribution.

.Example of material lacking ambient component
image::light_original.jpg[]

There are two solutions:

*Solution 1: Fix the material*

Convert the model to Collada .dae format, example:

`osgconv my_model.fbx my_model.dae`

Then open the .dae file in a text editor. Look for `<library_materials>` and the material references inside that element. The actual material definitions are (typically?) found under `<library_effects>`. There might be many types, but two that we encountered are `<phong>` and `<lambert>`. They should have a diffuse element, something like:

[source, xml]
----
<diffuse>
  <color sid="diffuse">0.8 0.8 0.8 1.0</color>
</diffuse>`
----

There might be a similar one for ambient. Check color values, if they are low, e.g. 0.2, try increase to max 1.0. If element is missing, just add it. In the end, it should look something like:

[source, xml]
----
<ambient>
  <color sid="ambient">1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0</color>
</ambient>`
----

Save the file as my_model_fixed.dae.

There is a script that automates this process, but it will only recognize phong and lambert material types: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/fix_dae_materials.py[fix_dae_materials.py].

Finally, convert the patched dae file to osgb: +
`osgconv my_model.dae my_model.osgb`

.Same model with patched material
image::light_patched_material.jpg[]

Different formats have different orientation frames. Hence it may be necessary to fix rotation. In that case, try something like: +
`osgconv my_model.dae -o 90-1,0,0 --use-world-frame my_model.osgb`

*Solution 2: Add light source*

Users can add up to two custom light sources, specifying position (x, y, z) and intensity. Examples:

Add one custom light source: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc .\resources\xosc\lane_change_crest.xosc --custom_light 4000,-6000,500,1.0`

Add two custom light sources: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc .\resources\xosc\lane_change_crest.xosc --custom_light 4000,-6000,500,0.4  --custom_light 5000,5000,200,0.2`

There are no fixed structure where scenario resources, e.g. vehicle 3D model or controller catalog, needs to be stored. Instead, additional search paths can be added by launch argument `--path <path>`. For example: +

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --path ../../ --path c:/tmp/my_models``

will add the relative path `../../` and absolute path `c:/tmp/my_models` to the list of places where to look for resources referred to by the scenario.

==== Blocked by Windows Defender SmartScreen

When esmini is downloaded as a zip file from Internet it might be blocked, i.e. prevented from being started, by Windows to protect your system. This is indicated by the following, or similar, message popping up when attempt to start:

"Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."

As long as the zip was downloaded from esmini official GitHub repository (https://github.com/esmini/esmini) it is perfectly safe to use.

The simplest solution is to unblock the zip file before unpacking it:

1. Right click
2. Click Properties
3. At bottom right, check "Unblock"

image::win-unblock.png[]

Note: This method also works for individual files after unzipping. But it can only be applied for one file at a time, why it's simpler to unblock the complete zip before unpacking.

It is also possible to unblock from Powershell command line:

* Single file: +
  `Unblock-File esmini-demo_Windows.zip`

* Multiple files recursively: +
  `Get-ChildItem -Path esmini-demo_Windows -Recurse | Unblock-File`

==== Mac issues and limitations

From esmini version 2.26.6 mac executables are universal binaries which means they work on both Intel and Apple Silicon based Macs. Following are some known issues and work arounds:

* Window can't be located in the upper part of the screen (some systems). If window won't open, try to adjust the y value (second entry) of the window argument. 60 pixels usually works fine, e.g: `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

* Issue has been reported that when multiple screens are connected esmini just shows a bland window. Currently only solution is to unplug the additional montitors or unplug Mac from dock station.

* Graphics can not run in separate thread. Hence the `--thread` launch flag will have no effect.

* On Mac the zip-package might be put in quarantine, to release it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine file.zip` or even better: `xattr -c file.zip`

* esmini executables are not signed with a https://developer.apple.com/developer-id[developer ID] - since we simply don't have one. If you got the package directly from https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases[esmini release page on GitHub] it is safe to unpack and run.
In order to execute the files you need to do one of following from a terminal in the folder the demo package was extracted:
** Remove quarantine flags: `xattr -c -r esmini-demo/bin`, or
** Sign executables for use on local machine: `codesign -f -s - esmini-demo/bin/*`

==== OpenStreetMap (OSM) roads in esmini
SUMO comes with a great tool, https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/netconvert.html[netconvert], that can convert road networks from and to various formats.

Prerequisite: Download and install SUMO from https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php[here].

Example: Convert an OSM map to OpenDRIVE for use in esmini:

`netconvert --osm-files city.osm --opendrive-output city.xodr --no-turnarounds`

Preview in odrviewer:

`./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr city.xodr`

==== Update 3D model pack

Do either:

- remove any `resources/models` folder
- from `./build` folder, run `cmake ..`

or

- get the package from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5gk8bvgzqiaaoco/models.7z?dl=1[here] and unpack files into `./resources/models`

==== Update 3rd party prebuilt libraries

There are a few external dependencies that takes long time to build from scratch. Instead they are provided in compressed packages including needed headerfiles and prebuilt libraries. The packages are available for Win, Mac and Linux. For Windows and Linux they include Debug mode binaries, in addition to the Release variant.

The cmake script will check for the availability of these libraries, by simply checking for existence of corresponding folders, e.g. osg, osi, sumo, under esmini/externals. If missing, compressed packages will be downloaded and extracted.

Not often, but at some points the prebuilt libraries needs to be updated. In most cases it affects the esmini build configuration and/or code. Hence, sometimes an update of esmini comes with a need to update the external libraries as well. Lack of automatic handling, such update needs to be done manually. One way is to delete the specific folder(s) and run ordinary cmake command again. But the simplest way is to enforce redownload of all packages:

`cmake .. -D  FORCE_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=TRUE`

The FORCE_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES flag will be checked by the cmake script for enforced download of all packages. Upon successful download, the libraries will be replaced, one by one.

Library updates are not detected by the esmini build dependencies, why a clean rebuild of esmini should be performed manually afterwards.

==== Entity does not appear
In order to appear in the scenario, without need for AddEntity action, an entity must be represented in the Init section of the Storyboard. Common is to add actions to establish inital position and speed.

Example:

[source, xml]
----
<PrivateAction>
   <TeleportAction>
      <Position>
         <LanePosition roadId="1" laneId="-1" offset="0" s="50"/>
      </Position>
   </TeleportAction>
</PrivateAction>
<PrivateAction>
   <LongitudinalAction>
      <SpeedAction>
         <SpeedActionDynamics dynamicsShape="step" dynamicsDimension="time" value="0.0"/>
         <SpeedActionTarget>
            <AbsoluteTargetSpeed value="30.0"/>
         </SpeedActionTarget>
      </SpeedAction>
   </LongitudinalAction>
</PrivateAction>
----

==== Heading behavior in Road vs Lane Position

In esmini, the behavior of the two position types https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/RoadPosition.html[`RoadPosition`] and https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/LanePosition.html[`LanePosition`] differ in terms of heading.

- `RoadPosition`: When not specified, the heading will align to the direction of the road (s-axis)
- `LanePosition`: When not specified, the heading will align to the driving direction of the lane

In the image below, the white cars are positioned by `RoadPosition` with `t=-1.5` and `t=1.5` respectively while the red cars are positioned by `LanePosition` with `laneId="-1"` and `laneId="1"` respectively.


.Positioning with RoadPosition (white) and LanePosition (red) - heading omitted
image::no-heading.jpg[]

Explicitly specified heading (in `Orientation` sub-element):

- Absolute heading will be respected and treated in the same way for both position cases
- Relative heading will be based on the default heading, i.e. road or driving direction respectively.

In next image, an `Orientation` element was added with *absolute* heading = 0.4 for all four cars.

.Positioning with RoadPosition (white) and LanePosition (red) - absolute heading=0.4
image::absolute-heading.jpg[]

In next image, an `Orientation` element was added with *relative* heading = 0.4 for all four cars.

.Positioning with RoadPosition (white) and LanePosition (red) - relative heading=0.4
image::relative-heading.jpg[]

Corresponding behavior applies also to `RelativeRoadPosition` and `RelativeLanePosition`.

===== Motivation

In some (maybe most) use cases it's preferred that vehicles align to the driving direction of the lane. But in other cases not, example: In an overtake maneuver, the overtaking car may start in the neighbor lane. The driving direction of the lane should not affect the heading of the car.

So the different strategies for `RoadPosition` and `LanePosition` was decided upon to support as many use cases as possible. For more background, see issues https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/385[#385] and https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues/228[#228].

==== OSI for Python on Windows

Follow the following steps to install OSI (and dependent Google Protobuf) for use by some esmini scripts, e.g. https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/osi2csv.py[osi2csv.py].

*Protobuf for Python* (skip if already installed)

. Open a Powershell
. `pip install protobuf==3.20.2`

*protoc* (Protobuf compiler)
[start=3]
. Download https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.20.2/protoc-3.20.2-win64.zip[protoc-3.20.2-win64.zip] +
  (release page: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.20.2)
. Unzip (at least protoc.exe) to some location

*OSI for Python*
[start=5]
. Open a Powershell in the to-be-parent folder of OSI
. `git clone https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface`
. `cd open-simulation-interface`
. `git checkout v3.5.0`
. `./convert-to-proto3.sh`
. `$env:PROTOC=<location of protoc.exe>` +
  for example: `$env:PROTOC="C:/tmp/protoc-3.20.2-win64/bin/protoc.exe"`
. `pip install .`

This should be it.

*How to remove old versions* (if needed)

. `pip uninstall protobuf`
. `pip uninstall open-simulation-interface`

==== The scenario runs too fast or too slow

esmini can run in two different time modes: 1. Real-time and 2. Fixed-time. Default is real-time.

The following command, from esmini root, will run real-time: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc` +

This one fixed-time: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

The difference is basically that real-time will run with as small time-steps as possible (actually limit at 1 ms to avoid unnecessary CPU load), maxim
zing precision but constrained by system clock. In other words, the scenario will play out in "natural" speed, good for previewing or demonstrating sc
narios. Each timestep is calculated by esmini based on passed system-time since last frame.

The fixed-time is simpler, esmini will simply execute the scenario as fast as possible applying the specified delta-time for each step. Good for runni
g tests for later post processing of resulting logs, data or OSI files.

A common use-case is to run esmini quick/headless and then utilize the replayer for viewing the result. See more info here: <<Replay scenario>>

==== Road and junction string IDs

OpenDRIVE allows for non integer string IDs. Although commonly unsigned integer is used. The standard https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/16_annexes/classes/road/top_cla_t_road.html[OpenDRIVE 1.8] states that IF the ID represents an integer number, it should comply to uint32_t and stay within the given range.

esmini partly supports* string IDs, by mapping to internal integer IDs. The way it works:

If the ID is a number in the range of 0..0xfffffffe (4 294 967 294), then: +
map it to the same internal ID +
Else, if the number is a string or a number out of range: +
map it to a unique internal ID

*Note*: 0xffffffff (4 294 967 295) is reserved for ID_UNDEFINED which is the default value and also used for error indication +

Example: Assume an OpenDRIVE includes the following road (or junction) IDs:

[source,console]
----
"0"
"1"
"124"
"Kalle"
"12k4"
"4294967296"
"4294967295"
"4294967294"
----

The IDs will be mapped as follows:

[source,console]
----
"0" -> 0
"1" -> 1
"124" -> 124
"Kalle" -> 125
"4294967296" -> 126 (too large)
"4294967295" -> 127 (conflict with ID_UNDEFINED)
"4294967294" -> 4294967294 (Ok, largest acceptable number)
----

Now, why not make use of available numbers between 1 and 124? It's because esmini is lazy, not spending effort (performance) to book-keep sorted list of IDs. Instead, only the largest number in use will be monitored.

In addition, there are esmini lib API functions to lookup string and internal IDs:

[source,c++]
----
const char *SE_GetRoadIdString(id_t road_id);
id_t SE_GetRoadIdFromString(const char *road_id_str);

const char *SE_GetJunctionIdString(id_t junction_id);
id_t SE_GetJunctionIdFromString(const char *junction_id_str);
----

That way, a custom application can find out what internal IDs esmini has assigned to any non-number string IDs.

Corresponding functions exist in esmini roadmanager lib.

pass:[*] String ID support was introduced in v2.37.15. By v2.39.0 internal representation changed from 32 bit signed int to unsigned int. At that point also undefined ID changed from -1 to 0xffffffff.

== Command reference

=== About options and config files

esmini, replayer and odrviewer can be controlled and configured by options. Even the input file (e.g. OpenSCENARIO file) is specified as an option.

Available options are listed later in this section, grouped by application.

Certain options, such as `path`, supports multiple values, denoted by '...' in the command help. For those options the values can be specified sequentially. Example: +
`--path /tmp/models /tmp/kalles_models`

Other options supports only one value. For those options the last parsed occurrence wins. Example: +
`--logfile_path my_log.txt --logfile_path kalles_log.txt` +
will create 'kalles_log.txt'

Options can be specified three ways:

1. From command line as application arguments, for example: `esmini --osc my_scenario.xosc --disable_stdout`
2. By API function SE_SetOption(), see <<Program Options>>
3. In config file, see more info below

==== Config file

The config file is basically a container for option presets. It can be used to apply common settings for esmini applications. For example, if you often use a specific window size, e.g. --window 60 60 800 400, then you can put it in a config file. Configuration file is structured with the application name as the root, followed by option-value pairs. Custom configuration file can be named and placed as needed.

Settings in config files can be overridden, both by other config files or by options specified on command line. Option files are parsed in order of appearance, last parsed option occurrence wins.

From version 2.46.0 esmini comes with a default `config.yml` located in esmini root folder. It contains just a few settings, e.g. default window position and size (60 60 800 400). Launching esmini from esmini root folder as:

`./bin/esmini --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

will then show cut-in scenario in a 800x400 window.

Exact content of the config.yml will vary over time, but initial version looks like this:

[source]
----
esmini:
  window: 60 60 800 400

replayer:
  window: 60 60 800 400
  res_path: ./resources
  file: sim.dat

odrviewer:
  window: 60 60 800 400
----


If you want another size of the window you have at least three options:

1. Edit the config.yml
2. Provide the `window` option values at command line, example:
  `./esmini --window 50 100 1400 500`
3. Create a custom config file, e.g. my_config.yml, including your preferred values

Example of my_config.yml:

[source]
----
esmini:
  window: 50 100 1400 500
  logfile_path: my_log.txt
----

Similarly, the scenario file can also be made part of default config file by adding `osc: ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc` to the config.yml. Or you can add it your custom config file above, like following:

[source]
----
esmini:
  window: 50 100 1400 500
  logfile_path: my_log.txt
  osc: ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc
----

Any number of config files can be specified as an option (`config_file_path`), either from another config file or at command line.

Example how to incorporate a custom config file on top of the default one:

`./esmini --config_file_path my_config.yml`

You can also add an entry in the default `config.yml`, example:

[source]
----
esmini:
  window: 50 100 1400 500
  logfile_path: my_log.txt
  config_file_path: my_config.yml
----

Now, running:

`./bin/esmini`

will load `cut-in.xosc`, using the one specified in default config. Window will be `50 100 1400 500` as specified in my_config, overriding the values in the default config.yml. The log file will be named my_log.txt as specified in my_config, overriding esmini default log file path.

Custom configuration file paths can be defined in the ESMINI_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. Multiple paths, delimited by ';' (Windows) or ':' (Linux/macOS), are permitted, which is particularly useful in Docker or similar environments.

Default config file is always parsed first, then the ones specified in the environment variable, and finally the ones specified on command line.

[Note]
====
**Note:**

The default 'config.yml' is applied automatically, while other config files needs to be specified explicitly.

Hence, although legit to add any setting to the default 'config.yml' file, it's recommended to separate basic common settings from temporary ones.

For example, create a 'my_settings.yml' for temporary preferences while putting permanent settings into 'config.yml'.

`./bin/esmini --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc` +
will apply basic settings only, while +

`./bin/esmini --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --config_file_path my_settings.yml` +
will also apply additional settings from the custom file.

This strategy avoids unexpected forgotten settings from a previous session being applied automatically.
====

==== Whitespace support

In option values any space will result in separation in multiple arguments.

Bad example:
```
esmini:
  path: ./resources/my scenarios /tmp
```
`./resources/my`, `scenarios`, `/tmp` is added as separate search paths. Probably not intended.

If space is needed, e.g. for file or directory paths, just enclose in quotes "".

Good example:
```
esmini:
  path: "./resources/my scenarios" /tmp
```
`./resources/my scenarios`, `/tmp` is added as separate search paths

==== Precedence
As mentioned, options that supports multiple values will store and access values according to order of appearance. Example:

`--path /tmp/my_car_models` `--path /tmp/kalles_car_models`

esmini will look in `kalles_car_models` first, and only if referred model is not found there it will continue looking in `my_car_models`.

Illustrative example:

image::options.png[]

==== Mutual exclusion
Dependencies exists among some options. Examples:

===== 'headless' and 'window'

'headless' overrides any preceding 'window' arguments, no rendering will happen. Conversely, 'window' following 'headless' results in an invisible window for off-screen rendering (e.g. saving images to file or grab pixels via API).

Examples:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc` +
no window will be created and no rendering performed, execution will be fast.

`./bin/esmini --headless --window 60 60 800 400 --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc` +
off-screen window will be created and rendered to, execution will be slower.

===== 'osc' and 'osc_str'
The last specified option prevails.

==== Config file usage example 1: Easy replaying

===== Without config

The typical procedure to create and replay a scenario recording (DAT file) is as follows:

Create DAT file: +
`./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --record sim.dat --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Play DAT file: +
`./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --file sim.dat`

====== With config

Create `cfg_dat.yml` in esmini root as:

```
esmini:
  headless: true
  record: sim.dat
  fixed_timestep: 0.05

replayer:
  window: 60 60 800 400
  res_path: ./resources
  file: sim.dat
```

Create DAT file: +
`./bin/esmini --config_file_path ./cfg_dat.yml --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Play DAT file: +
`./bin/replayer --config_file_path ./cfg_dat.yml`

==== Config file usage example 2: Easy video creation

===== Without config

The typical procedure to create a video clip from a scenario is as follows:

Create image files: +
`./bin/esmini --headless --window 0 0 1920 1080 --fixed_timestep 0.016667 --screen_capture --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

A series of TGA images (screen_shot_00000.tga, screen_shot_00001.tga ...) is created in current folder. Resolution in this case is 1920x1080 (HD). Timestep 0.016668 correlates to 60 fps.

There are many ways to convert the images into a video clip. Example using ffmpeg:

`ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 60 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -crf 15 out.mp4`

See <<Create video clip of a scenario>> for more info on ffmpeg.

====== With config

It's a bit tricky to remember resolution and timestep settings for esmini. Now you can create config files for favorite settings. For example:

Create `cfg_hd.yml` in esmini root as:

```
esmini:
  headless: true
  window: 0 0 1920 1080
  fixed_timestep: 0.016667
  capture_screen: true
```
and `cfg_sd.yml` as:

```
esmini:
  headless: true
  window: 0 0 720 480
  fixed_timestep: 0.033333
  capture_screen: true
```

Create images for HD/60fps: +
`./bin/esmini --config_file_path ./cfg_hd.yml --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

and SD/30fps: +
`./bin/esmini --config_file_path ./cfg_sd.yml --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

You still need to supply corresponding `framerate` argument to ffmpeg: +

`ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 60 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -crf 15 out.mp4`

and

`ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -crf 15 out.mp4`

respectively.

== Build guide

=== Build configurations in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
From esmini version 2.29.0 a set of cmake presets are provided. These can be utilized from Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio (from 2019 version 16.10 onwards, see more info https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-presets-vs?view=msvc-170[here]) with the CMake Tools extension.

=== Build configurations from command line
https://cmake.org/[CMake] tool is used to create standard make configurations. A few example "create..." batch scripts are supplied (in `scripts` folder) as examples how to generate desired build setup from command line.

- VisualStudio / win64 / Windows SDK v10 / Release and Debug
- Ubuntu and Kubuntu (tested on 18.04) / gcc / Release and Debug

However, it should be possible to configure custom variants using cmake. For example to use Visual Studio 2019 run the following commands from command prompt (CMD or PowerShell), assuming starting point is esmini root folder:

....
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
....

This will first generate Visual Studio solution and then compile esmini using MSVC toolset v142 (default with Visual Studio 2019). Default architecture should be x64.

If you want to compile with MSVC 2017 toolset just add directive to the generator as follows:

``
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T v141
``

A complete list of supported toolsets are available https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.17/variable/MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION.html[here].

Provided 3rd party lib binaries are only provided for Windows x64 architecture. To make sure you build for x64 add `-A x64`, For example:

``
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T v141 -A x64
``

If you want to compile with MSVC 2015 (v140) toolset and for win32 use the following generator command:

``
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T v140 -A Win32 ..
``

[Note]
====
**Note:**

Provided 3rd party libs only available for x64 builds. If you need to build full esmini for Win32 (32bit), you need to compile the 3rd party libraries yourself. Perhaps the "scripts/generate_*_libs.sh" scripts can be a starting point for such an endeavor.

Another possibility for Win32 is to build a slim esmini with a minimum of dependencies. See <<Slim esmini - customize configration>>.
====


Of course, building with a specific toolset requires it to be installed. Use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019[Visual Studio Installer]. Steps:

- choose "Modify"
- make sure Desktop Development with C++ is checked
- go to tab "Individual components"
- scroll down to "Compilers, build tools, and runtimes"
- check the MSVC versions you need, e.g. "MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C\++ build tools (v14.00)" and "MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)"

All configurations defines an "Install" build target that compiles (if needed) and copies relevant binaries into a common "esmini/bin" folder recognized by the example scripts under the "esmini/run" folder.

*Note:*

- For automatic downloading of external dependencies (OSG binaries) and 3D models, CMake version 3.11.4 or above is required (FetchContent_MakeAvailable was introduced). +

- In Windows, if you get an error like "the c compiler identification is unknown", then please make sure to install "Windows Universal CRT SDK" from the Visual Studio Installer tool.

=== External dependencies

esmini is designed to link all dependencies statically. Main reason is to have a all-inclusive library for easy integration either as a shared library/DLL (e.g. plugin in Unity, or S-function in Simulink) or statically linked into a native application.

*Note:* Nothing stops you from going with all dynamic linking, it's just that provided build scripts are not prepared for it.

CMake scripts will download several pre-compiled 3rd party packages and 3D model resource files.

Default location for these resources is Google drive. If there is an issue, try switch to the backup location at Dropbox by changing the following line in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt[EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt]:

``set ( FILE_STORAGE "google" )`` +
to +
``set ( FILE_STORAGE "dropbox" )`` +

Links to all packages can be found in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt[EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt].

If you need to (re)build a 3rd party lib for some reason, e.g. for an yet unsupported system or need for a specific version, these build scripts might be a starting point:

- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osg_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osg_libs.sh]
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osi_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osi_libs.sh]
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_sumo_libs.sh[scripts/generate_sumo_libs.sh]

or this script that builds all three libs, combining the above ones:

https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osi_sumo_osg_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osi_sumo_osg_libs.sh]

=== Additional platform dependencies

Linux Ubuntu

[source]
----
sudo apt install build-essential gdb ninja-build git pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libgdal-dev libpoppler-dev libdcmtk-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev curl cmake black
----

Also, g\++ version >= 5 is needed for c++14 code support.

Windows and Mac: Install the https://cmake.org/[cmake] application

=== Run and Debug with Linux and visual studio code

To run from the visual studio, the steps below might help with setup configuration.

==== With preset
*Note:* Make sure cmake.preset set to auto to recognize the presets (defined in the `CMakePresets.json` file). Open setting (Ctrl + ,) type `cmake.preset`, set `auto` in drop down box. This is a global setting.

To run:

. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run CMake: Configure. Select `ubuntu_release`
. Shift + F7 to select and build specific target
  ** e.g. `install` to build and copy all targets to bin folder
. Configure custom run arguments (create launch.json)
  ** Open the run and debug window (Ctrl+Shift+D)
  ** Select `create a launch.json file`
  ** In the drop down list, select `C++ (GDB/LLDB)`
  ** Select `Add Configuration...` (in the lower right corner of the sub window)
  ** Select `C/C++: (gdb) Launch`
  ** Change `program` setting as `"${workspaceFolder}/build/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/esmini/esmini"`
  ** Change `args` as `["--window", "60", "60", "800", "400", "--osc", "../resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc"]`
. Press F5

For Debug,
Repeat step 1 and select `ubuntu_debug`. Repeat step 2 to build debug binaries and then step 4. Breakpoints can be added to the program specified in the `launch.json` file (do step 3 if not already done).

Build target can also be changed in the status bar, click `Set the default build target`. If not cmake commands are visible in status bar, check global settings: Ctrl + ,  then write "cmake status bar" to find `Status Bar Visibility` setting. Set to `visible`.

Another way to set build target is via Ctrl+Shift+P, then write "set build target" to find `CMake: Set Build Target` setting. Select it and choose build target in the drop down list that should appear.

==== Without preset

Make sure `cmake.preset` set to never to ignore the preset file (`CMakePresets.json`):

* Open setting (Ctrl+,) type cmake.preset, select `never` in drop down box

*Note:* This is a global setting, i.e. will affect other VSCode instances. Reset to `auto` if needed. Another way to ignore the presets is simply to remove the `CMakePresets.json` file and restart VSCode.

To run:

. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `CMake: Select a Kit`. Select the compiler you want to use. For example GCC 11.3.0
. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) run the `CMake: Select Variant` command. Select `Release`
. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) run the `CMake: Set Build Target`. Select `install`
. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the `CMake: Build` command, or select the Build button from the Status bar. (If cmake commands are not visible in status bar, check global settings: Ctrl + ,  then write "cmake status bar" to find `Status Bar Visibility` setting. Set to `visible`.)
. To configure launch arguments, see step 3 in <<With preset>>.
. Press F5

For debug:

Repeat step 2 and select `Debug`. Repeat step 3 to 6. Breakpoints can be added to the program specified in the `launch.json`.

For more info see: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux

=== Dynamic protobuf linking
When linking esmini with software already dependent on Google protobuf there might be need for dynamic linking of shared protobuf library. This can be achieved by defining cmake symbol DYN_PROTOBUF as following example:

``cmake .. -D DYN_PROTOBUF=True``

Then build as usual. It will link with protobuf shared library instead of linking with a static library.

When running esmini, the protobuf shared library needs to be found. Set dynamic library path environment variable to the folder where the library is. Example:

Linux: +
``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./externals/OSI/linux/lib-dyn``

macOS: +
``export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./externals/OSI/linux/lib-dyn``

*Note:* +
The dynamic versions of protobuf were added Aug 31 2021. So you might need to update the OSI library package. Get the latest from following links:

- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/an58ckp2qfx5069/osi_v10.7z?dl=0[OSI Windows]
- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kwtdg0c1c8pawa1/osi_linux.7z?dl=0[OSI Linux]
- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/m62v19gp0m73dte/osi_mac.7z?dl=0[OSI Mac]

=== Slim esmini - customize configration

The external dependencies OSG, OSI, SUMO and implot are optional. Also the unit test suite is optional, in effect making the dependecy to googletest framework optional as well. All these options are simply controlled by the following cmake options:

- USE_OSG
- USE_OSI
- USE_SUMO
- USE_GTEST
- USE_IMPLOT

So, for example, to cut dependency to OSG and SUMO, run:  +
``cmake .. -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False``

To disable OSG, SUMO, OSI and googletest, run:  +
``cmake .. -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False -D USE_OSI=False -D USE_GTEST=False -D USE_IMPLOT=False``

All options are enabled/True as default.

*Note:* +
Disabling an external dependency will disable corresponding functionality. So, for example, disabling OSI means that no OSI data can be created by esmini. Disabling OSG means that esmini can't visualize the scenario. However it can still run the scenario and create a .dat file, which can be played and visualized later in another esmini build in which OSG is enabled (even on another platform).

=== MSYS2 / MinGW-w64 support

esmini slim can be compiled and executed in the MSYS2 environment. Try following steps:

* Download MSYS2 from: https://www.msys2.org
* Install with default options
* Start MSYS2 MinGW x64 (e.g. from start menu)
* Update MSYS2 packages, run: +
  ``
  pacman -Syu --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm
  `` +
  (MSYS2 should close automatically)
* Restart MSYS2
* Finalize update and install needed packages, run:

[source]
----
pacman -Su --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm
----

* Optional (not needed to compile or run esmini): +
  ``pacman -S git --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm``

* Build esmini (from MSYS2 MinGW x64 command line):

[source]
----
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False -D USE_OSI=False -D USE_GTEST=False ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
----

=== Build esmini project
First generate build configuration (see above)

Then it should work on all platform to build using cmake as follows: +
``cmake --build . --config Release --target install``

Or you can go with platform specific ways of building:

*Windows/Visual Studio*

. Open generated solution, build*/EnvironmentSimulator.sln
. Select configuration, Debug or Release
. Build CMakePredefinedTargets/INSTALL (right-click and select build)

*macOS*

To generate a Xcode project file, run the initial cmake command as follows: +
``cmake -G Xcode ..``

Then build as usual: +
``cmake --build . --config Release --target install``

or using Xcode directly: +
``xcodebuild -scheme install -configuration Release build``

or open the generated project file in Xcode, and build from there.

To create bundles (shared library container), do from esmini root folder: +

[source]
----
lipo -create bin/libesminiRMLib.dylib -output bin/esminiRMLib.bundle
lipo -create bin/libesminiLib.dylib -output bin/esminiLib.bundle
----

*Linux*

Once `cmake ..` has created the build configuration, of course you can build by calling the gnu `make` applciation directly instead of going via `cmake --build` as described above.

[source]
----
cd build
make -j4 install
----

This will build all projects, in four parallel jobs, and copy the binaries into a dedicated folder found by the demo batch scripts.

=== CentOS 7 (Linux)

CentOS 7 has some limitations, e.g. old versions of C/C\++ compiler toolkits and runtimes. So it's not possible to link with provided 3rd party binary libraries targeting Ubuntu 18++.
However, by disabling some featuers in esmini, e.g. OSI and SUMO, it can still be used for previewing scenarios.

VirtualBox image for Windows host here: +

== For esmini developers and contributors

Brief info on how to contribute is found here: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Complementing the <<Build guide>> this section contains additional information regarding branch strategy, formatting and test.

=== Branch strategy

From v2.30.0 the https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/dev[`dev`] branch was introduced as the new top branch for continuous integration of features and bug fixes.

image::branch-strategy.jpg[]

`dev` branch contains the latest integrated features and bug fixes. New features should be developed in branches created from `dev`. https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master[`master`] is the default branch and primarily reserved for official releases.

Continuous integration job will be launched for pushed commits on the following branches:

* `master`
* `dev`
* any other branch starting with `feature/`, e.g. `feature/support_emergency_vehicles`

Pull requests should be targeting the `dev` branch.

Master branch represent the latest released software. It should be in synch with dev.

==== Branch out of synch

`dev` and `master` branches should be in perfect sync, i.e. based on common history. Unfortunately, to keep this true and to avoid messy history and lost tags, branch history might be changed in rare cases. That can lead to local branch clones out of synch. If that is the case, follow these steps to restore sync of your local branch:

1. `git branch backup`  (only needed if you have local commits you want to preserve for later cherry-picking)
2. `git fetch origin`
3. `git reset --hard origin/<branch name>`

`<branch name>` might be `master` or `dev`, or whatever branch to be restored.

=== Formatting and code analysis

From esmini v2.30.0 the CI will include formatting checks, in addition to static analysis and tests.

From v2.46.3, esmini utilizes https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit hooks] for these checks. For details of previous implementation, see older versions of this document, e.g. https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esmini/esmini.github.io/refs/tags/v2.46.2/index.html[v2.46.2].

The code styles are defined by following schemes:

[horizontal]
*C++* :: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/.clang-format[.clang-format]
*Python* :: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/.black-format[.black-format]
*cmake* :: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/.cmake-format[.cmake-format]
*cppcheck*:: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/.pre-commit-config.yaml[.pre-commit-config.yaml]


esmini uses pre-commit hooks to automatically perform code formatting and static code analysis. To enable this functionality, install the pre-commit package:
```
pip install pre-commit
```
Then, run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks in esmini root folder. This sets up the pre-commit hooks, enabling automatic checks when making commits:
```
pre-commit install
```

==== Dependencies

===== Install dependent Python packages
[source, txt]
----
pip install -r ./support/python/requirements.txt
----

===== clang-format
[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Download and install https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-15.0.7/LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe[LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe]
*Linux*:: ```sudo apt install clang-format```

===== cppcheck
[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Download and install https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/releases/download/2.17.1/cppcheck-2.17.1-x64-Setup.msi[cppcheck-2.17.1-x64-Setup.msi]
*Linux*:: ```sudo apt install cppcheck```

====== Cppcheck version in esmini CI/CD
The CI/CD pipeline uses Cppcheck version 2.17 for static code analysis. If you require a different version of Cppcheck, perhaps due to specific dependencies, it is recommended to leverage the esmini CI/CD environment itself. To do this, create a fork of the esmini repository and run your static analysis within that environment simply by pushing your code changes. This ensures consistency with the CI/CD setup.

====== Using a different Cppcheck version locally
If you prefer to use a different version of Cppcheck locally or do not want to install version 2.17 system-wide, follow the instructions below.

If you have a different version installed or don't want to install 2.17 system-wide, see steps below for your platform.

====== For Linux and macOS

Download Cppcheck 2.17.1 source from:

https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/archive/refs/tags/2.17.1.tar.gz

Extract it to your home directory (for example, to ~/cppcheck-2.17.1).

Build it:
[source, txt]
----
cd ~/cppcheck-2.17.1
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
----

To run pre-commit using this local build of Cppcheck 2.17, run the following from your esmini root folder:
[source, txt]
----
PATH="$HOME/cppcheck-2.17.1/build/bin:$PATH" pre-commit run cppcheck --all-files
----

This command temporarily uses your locally built Cppcheck 2.17 without changing your system default.

====== For Windows

Download the official Cppcheck 2.17 installer from:

https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/releases/download/2.17.1/cppcheck-2.17.1-x64-Setup.msi

Make sure to install it to a separate directory than any previous Cppcheck version you want to keep.

==== Manually apply specific format
To run formatting locally, follow steps below.

[source, txt]
----
pre-commit run clang-format --all-files
pre-commit run cmake-format --all-files
pre-commit run black --all-files
----

==== Manually analyse code
[source, txt]
----
pre-commit run cppcheck --all-files
----

or formatting and code analysis can be done in one step by:
----
pre-commit run --all-files
----

==== Automatic formatting and code analysis
pre-commit will automatically run on each commit on all staged files. Sometimes automatic application maybe not needed for instance work in progress etc. In that case, you can skip the pre-commit hook by using the `--no-verify` option when committing:

[source, txt]
----
git commit -m "my commit message" --no-verify
----

=== Test

==== Test frameworks

There are two sets of tests on different frameworks:

1. Unit tests (white box)

2. Smoke tests (black box)

The unit tests suites are basically C++ code modules of test cases based on the https://github.com/google/googletest[Google Test] framework. They range from true unit tests (testing individual classes or functions) to system level tests reading a scenario and inspecting output, e.g. log files or visualization pixel data. The key feature of the unit tests is the possibility to inspect internal objects and variables.

Example: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/RoadManager_test.cpp[Unittest/RoadManager_test.cpp]

The smoke test suite is basically execution of a selection of scenarios with some strategic inspections of the result. Scenario elements and timing can be checked against log file while object info such as position, rotation and speed can be checked against dat file entries. A Python framework handles the execution and gathering of result for convenient checking.

The smoke test script is found here: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/test/smoke_test.py[test/smoke_test.py]

==== Run tests

For easy execution of all tests, both unit tests and smoke tests, run this main test script: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/run_tests.sh[scripts/run_tests.sh], from esmini root folder:

`./scripts/run_tests.sh`

Tip: On Windows, run it from GIT bash.

==== Run XML schema validation tests

XML schema validation ensures scenario files (xosc and xodr) complies with the OpenSCENARIO and OpenDrive XSD schemas. The checks are done by the Python script `run_schema_comply.py` located in the `scripts` directory. The schema files are located in the `resources/schema` directory. From release v2.40, all esmini scenario files are validated against the schemas as part of CI.

The script depends on the `xmlschema` and `lxml` Python packages. To install required packages, run:

`pip install -r support/python/requirements.txt`

Run the XML validation tests:

`python3 ./scripts/run_schema_comply.py <path1> [path2] [path3] ...`

where path can be an XML file or a directory. Any directory subfolders will be included recursively.

Example 1, check single file:

`python3 scripts/run_schema_comply.py resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Example 2, check two files:

`python3 scripts/run_schema_comply.py resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc resources/xodr/two_plus_one.xodr`

Example 3, check two directories:

`python3 scripts/run_schema_comply.py resources EnvironmentSimulator`

Example 4, check one file and one directory:

`python3 scripts/run_schema_comply.py EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/xosc/conflicting-domains.xosc resources`

Tip: Use bash `find` command to apply finer filtering. Example:

`python3 scripts/run_schema_comply.py $(find ./resources ./EnvironmentSimulator -name "follow_route*.xosc" -or -name "\*500*.xodr" -or -name "*signs.xodr")`

validates all OpenSCENARIO files starting with "follow_route" and all OpenDRIVE files containing "500" or ending basename with "signs" or containing "500", in and under the `resource` and `EnvironmentSimulator` folders.

=== Sanitizers

Google sanitizers framework is utilized to detect memory related errors, for example memory leaks. It's executed nighly as a GitHub CI actions job on dev branch. The job can also be trigged manually, but will only run checks on dev branch. Sanitizers is currently only applied to Linux builds.

You can also run the sanitizer checks locally (on any branch, even uncommitted code) on Ubuntu:

. Set the following environment variables, run from esmini root:

[source,console]
----
export LSAN_OPTIONS="print_suppressions=false:suppressions=$(pwd)/scripts/LSAN.supp"
export ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1:strict_string_checks=1:detect_stack_use_after_return=1:check_initialization_order=1:strict_init_order=1:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0:suppressions=$(pwd)/scripts/ASAN.supp"
----

[start=2]
. Configure and build esmini with sanitizers enabled

[source,console]
----
cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DUSE_OSG=FALSE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DENABLE_SANITIZERS=TRUE ..
ninja install
cd ..
----

[start=3]
. Run the test suites, including both unit- and smoke tests, from esmini root:

[source,console]
----
./scripts/run_tests.sh
----

==== Troubleshooting

On Ubuntu some combination of gcc and sanitizer randomly cause sanitizer run failure with error message: AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL.

If this happens, try the following:

[source,console]
----
setarch $(uname -m) -R
bash
----

`setarch` will affect reported architecture from system to sanitizer. `bash` is to restore shell environment, it can of course be replaced by any shell program, e.g. tcsh.

To revert settings, simply run:
[source,console]
----
exit
exit
----

First exit will escape the latter bash environment, the second reverts effect of the setarch command.

== esmini lib programming

=== About the lib itself

The main idea with esmini lib is to provide a limited, simplifed but useful API to the complex world of esmini, OpenSCENARIO and traffic simulation. By making use of only standard C types it has been possible to wrap and use the library in numerous environments, like for example MATLAB, Simulink and Unity (C#).

esmini lib is a, so called, shared library which is linked dynamically with a custom application. This means that it's not linked statically with the application, instead it's loaded whenever the application is launched. An obvious advantage with shared libraries is that they can be shared between multiple applications, reducing size and potentially simplify maintenance.

An additional important advantage with dynamic linking is that the library can be updated without need to recompile the custom application making use of the library (however it can't be updated during runtime, only in between launches). An obvious requirement is that the API is compatible when replacing a library with a different version, since the API is established at link-time. On the other side of the "same coin", a disadvantage with dynamic linking is that you need to have the shared library present at run-time.

Although esmini lib is a shared library itself, it includes everything needed in terms of 3rd party functionality. It's actally linking all dependencies statically. Think about it as a single container including everything needed, e.g. support for 3D graphics, XML, expressions, and SUMO traffic simulation. There are two advantages with this approach: 1. Getting rid of dependency to hundreds of 3rd party shared libraries and 2. The linker makes sure to only include relevant functions which reduce the size by extreme (compared to bundle individual and complete shared libraries).

[Note]
====
**Note:** esmini utilizes, in accordance with pass:[C++] standard, default values on some function parameters in the API. Those default values will work at least in any pass:[C++] context. For other environments like pure C, C# or Python it might be required to explicitly supply argument values.

=== How to interact with esmini lib API

Below is a typical interaction between a custom application (e.g. vehicle simulator) and esmini (providing simulation of the environment, like road and traffic).

=== Functionality
No systematic documentation available. See header files https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp[esminiLib.hpp] and https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiRMLib/esminiRMLib.hpp[esminiRMLib.hpp] for API details.

The following section covers some specific use cases of the library.

==== Save or grab images

Screenshots can be controlled via the API:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_SaveImagesToFile(int nrOfFrames);
----
nrOfFrames: -1 => continuously, 0 => stop, > 0 => number of frames, e.g. 1=next frame only, 2=next two frames

Images will be stored in current folder with name `screen_shot_*.tga` (* = counter) for post processing.

Images can also be saved to memory for instant processing. Control the feature with:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_SaveImagesToRAM(bool state);
----
state: true => capture images, false => don't capture (default, might improve performance on some systems)

Grab image with:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_FetchImage(SE_Image *image);
----
image is a reference to a SE_Image struct which will contain the image meta and image data

See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture[image-capture] code example.

[Note]
====
**Note:** In order to grab a rendered frame image, it must have been saved to RAM during the post rendering phase. First frame will be saved to RAM by default. The SE_SaveImagesToRAM() function must be used to enable the feature for frames > 0.

The reason for not enable always by default is performance savings. On some system the operation to read back rendered pixels from graphics frame buffer to application RAM memory is not neglectable (depending on whether color coding or byte order transformation is needed). So a compromize is to have the feature enabled for the first init frame, and then activate by user when needed.
====

Finally, to disable esmini image handling altogether and revert to OSG default handling, make the following call before SE_Init():

``SE_SetOffScreenRendering(false);``

Note that disabling the this will permanently disable the callback mechanism for the complete esmini session (overriding any SE_SaveImagesToRAM() call).

==== Custom camera positions
Similarly as with camera related launch arguments, <<Camera control, camera positioning>> can be controlled via esmini lib API.

- `SE_AddCustomCamera()` +
  Add a camera with relative position and orientation (heading and pitch)
- `SE_AddCustomFixedCamera()` +
  Add a fixed camera at custom global position and orientation (heading and pitch)
- `SE_AddCustomAimingCamera()` +
  Add a camera with relative position looking at current entity
- `SE_AddCustomFixedAimingCamera()` +
  Add a camera at fixed location but always looking at current entity
- `SE_AddCustomFixedTopCamera()` +
  Add a top view camera with fixed position and rotation
- `SE_SetCameraObjectFocus` +
  Set/change object to focus on

More info, see https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/91c82fb78deb4355f736f87510069f52cc0e6be5/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L1519C1-L1582C59[headerfile].

Any number of cameras can be defined. These cameras can then be activated via function: `SE_SetCameraMode()`.

Applications can even loop through the camera modes to produce images from several cameras. See code example https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture/multiple-cameras.cpp[multiple-cameras.cpp].

==== OSI data

OSI data can be retrieved in three ways:

. Storing OSI tracefile
. Receive in UDP packages
. Receive via API call

===== OSI tracefile

Call `SE_EnableOSIFile(filename)` in order to create a OSI tracefile. Specify custom filename or set 0 or "" to use default filename (currently "ground_truth.osi").

===== OSI timestamps

By default, the OSI timestamps are set to the same value as the simulation time. The timestamps can be explicity set for each frame via `SE_SetOSITimeStamp(unsigned long long int nanoseconds)`. This will set the time for the upcoming frame, and should thus be set prior to each call to `SE_Step*`.

**Note:** If any OSI related function call has been made prior to `SE_Init*` esmini will activate OSI and the OSI data, including timestamps, will be populated during the `SE_Init*` call.

===== OSI settings

The following settings are available for OSI via API:

* `SE_SetOSIFrequency(int frequency)` +
  how frequent the OSI data shall be updated (*default* 1, i.e. every frame)
* `SE_SetOSIStaticReportMode(SE_OSIStaticReportMode mode)` +
  how to report and log static objects in OSI (*default* is to report and log only once)
* `SE_ExcludeGhostFromGroundTruth()` +
  exclude ghost object from OSI groundtruth (*default* is to include ghost)
* `SE_CropOSIDynamicGroundTruth(int id, double radius)` +
  crop dynamic OSI groundtruth around an entity (*default* is to include all)

See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp[esminiLib.hpp] for more API details.

Corresponding functions are available via command line arguments:

- `--osi_freq <frequency>`
- `--osi_static_reporting_mode <mode>`
- `--osi_exclude_ghost`

See <<_esmini>>, or run: `esmini --help`, for full option description.

===== OSI via UDP

By launch argument `--osi_receiver_ip <ip addr>` you can have esmini sending OSI packeges in UDP frames. The socket port is hardcoded but can of course be changed in the code (OSI_OUT_PORT in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/ScenarioEngine/SourceFiles/OSIReporter.cpp)[OSIReporter.cpp]).

See receiver side code example https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/replayer/osi_receiver.cpp[osi_receiver.cpp].

===== OSI data via API call

Fetch OSI data by either one of the API calls:

- `SE_GetOSIGroundTruthRaw()`
- `SE_GetOSIGroundTruth(int* size)`

The "raw" version will simply return a pointer to the already existing OSI data structure, no additional data copying will be performed. The "raw" option is the preferered option if the application is coded in C++, making the Protobuf data structures fully compatible.

See code example: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/osi-groundtruth[osi-groundtruth], also covered in User guide - Hello world tutorial https://esmini.github.io/#_osi_groundtruth[OSI groundtruth].

The second function will fetch the OSI data serialized into a string. This will be a true copy and also generic format which can be parsed in any environment, independent of OS and programming language. The backside is additional resources needed for the copying and serialization.

See code examples in ScenarioEngineDLL test cases, e.g: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/97d5f6216c53655545b5466400d00e98d99d25c2/EnvironmentSimulator/Unittest/ScenarioEngineDll_test.cpp#L933-L975[receive_GroundTruth].

[Note]
====
**Note:**

OSI groundtruth reported via the API always contains both static and dynamic objects in the first frame. By default subsequent frames will only contain dynamic objects. The same data is also stored in the OSI log file, given that the log file is enabled.

However, the behavior can be configured as follows:

The dynamic objects are reported every frame. How the static objects are reported and logged can be controlled by `SE_SetOSIStaticReportMode` function. The available options are according to the enum `SE_OSIStaticReportMode`:

- `SE_OSIStaticReportMode::DEFAULT` - Report and log static objects only once
- `SE_OSIStaticReportMode::API` - Report static objects in every frame, but only once in the log file
- `SE_OSIStaticReportMode::API_AND_LOG` - Report and log static objects every frame

OSI groundtruth will be up to date automatically after each `SE_Step*` depending on the OSI frequency, which can be changed to facilitate use-cases where esmini is running at much higher frequency than needed for OSI data (e.g. for vehicle dynamics purposes). To optimize performance, OSI update can then be skipped most frames and only run when needed. For example: `SE_SetOSIFrequency(20);` will update OSI data only every 20th frame.
====

==== Program Options

On top of setting options from command line, esmini (from v2.41.0) supports setting options from esminiLib and esminiRMLib as well. This new functionality is added to set and unset options during runtime. This is useful, for example, to enable or disable logging to console, or to change log level etc between scenario runs via API. In addition, it is now possible to make option settings persistent over multiple runs of scenarios. There are two variants of the API functions i.e. one to set option value with persistence and one without. The API functions are:

SE_DLL_API int SE_SetOption(const char *name);

SE_DLL_API int SE_SetOptionPersistent(const char *name);

SE_DLL_API int SE_SetOptionValue(const char *name, const char *value);

SE_DLL_API int SE_SetOptionValuePersistent(const char *name, const char *value);

SE_DLL_API int SE_UnsetOption(const char *name);

SE_DLL_API const char *SE_GetOptionValue(const char *name);

Any setting done in between runs, i.e. after any SE_Close() and before SE_Init(), will apply to the next run, at least. The persistent variant will apply for all future runs until unset or other setting overrides it. The effect of settings done during a scenario run will depend on the option itself. For example, anti-aliasing mode for the rendering will not change during a scenario, while logfile path can change during a scenario run (which will close current and open a new file with specified path and name). So, to be sure, set options before SE_Init() and after any SE_Close().

==== Simple ideal sensors

OSI provides information needed for sensor models at bounding box level for both moving and stationary objects, including ones defined in OpenDRIVE. Sensor models can then detect overlap, occlusion and collisions between those bounding boxes. Although sensor models are not within scope of esmini, there is a code example on how to retrieve and extract OSI data. It can perhaps be a starting point: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/osi-groundtruth/osi-groundtruth.cpp[osi-groundtruth.cpp]

For even simpler use cases esmini provides a sensor mechanism, basically collecting scenario objects which reference point is within a sensor view frustum. This is too rough for collision detection, but can be useful for low-pass features like adaptive cruse control (ACC) or just optimizing CPU load by filtering objects for some processing.

The view frustum is defined by a horizontal `field of view` combined with `near` and `far` limits. Basically an object is detected by a ideal sensor if the object reference point is within the view frustum, i.e:

- angle from sensor mounting point is within the `field of view`
- distance from sensor mounting point is larger than `near` and less than `far`

.A few ideal sensors mounted at various positions and orientations
image::ideal_sensors.jpg[]

The sensors are added from the code, see the https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/esmini-dyn[esmini-dyn] code example. API is found https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp#L1082-L1095[here].

Limitations:

- OpenDRIVE stationary objects not considered
- Only reference point checking (part of the object can be inside frustum and still not detected)

==== Logging

By default, both file and console logging are enabled. Default log filename is `log.txt`. Default location is current folder, normally the folder from which the application was started.

All this can be controlled and modified through the API. Full details see log related functions in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp[esminiLib.hpp]. Following is a brief overview:

===== Enable or disable logging to console

[source,c++]
----
void SE_LogToConsole(bool mode);
----

An additional way to control console logging is to set or unset the launch option `--disable_stdout` using the API functions:

[source,c++]
----
int SE_SetOption(const char *name);
int SE_UnsetOption(const char *name);
----

with `--disable_stdout` as argument.

===== Change log filename and/or location

[source,c++]
----
void SE_SetLogFilePath(const char *logFilePath);
----

- Full path (relative or absolute) can be provided, e.g. `"../myresult/scenario_2.txt"`.
- If only directory provided, default filename will be used.
- If only filename provided, default location will be used.
- if empty string `""` is provided, log file will not be created.

It should be called before SE_Init(). If called during the run of a scenario, the current log file will be closed and a new with the specified name and/or location will be created, unless `--log_append` option has been set.

===== Log single message

[source,c++]
----
void SE_LogMessage(const char *message);
----

the provided string will be posted to console and file according to settings.

== Scenario construction tips

We often get questions regarding construction of scenarios. We also have seen many scenarios that could be improved in various ways.

As long as a scenario validates (try https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/scripts/run_schema_comply.py[run_schema_comply.py]) and runs as expected, the scenario does the job. One beauty of OpenSCENARIO XML and OpenDRIVE is the low threshold to get started.

For example, consider recorded scenarios: Roads can be represented in OpenDRIVE by a sequence of line segments, connecting measure points. Similarly, recorded driving data can easily be converted into OpenSCENARIO XML polyline trajectories.

Although the above approach is easy, it results in inefficient (large data), non precise (line segments approximating the real world scenario). Also, the line-segments approach results in gaps and/or discontinuities which might cause trouble for sensor models.

In this section we present a few learnings and ideas on how scenarios can be designed in a way unlocking the full potential of the standards in terms of quality, flexibility, efficiency, and control.

=== OpenDRIVE

- The tangent of the road geometry should be continuous. So, curves should not be implemented as piecewise linear segments. For inspiration how to create curves from linear segments, see script example https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/scripts/xodr_lines2curves.py[xodr_lines2curves.py].

- For constructed roads it works well with line and/or arc segments, connected by clothoid segments ensuring continuous curvature change-rate. See steering wheel figure in
https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/09_geometries/09_01_introduction.html[OpenDRIVE geometry section].

- For measured roads it's typically better to use parametric curves, https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/09_geometries/09_06_param_poly3.html[paramPoly3].

- Connected roads needs to be without gaps and overlaps. See https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/10_roads/10_03_road_linkage.html[Road Linkage].

- Longer geometries, lane sections and road elements are preferred. Variations along the road, for example adding or removing lanes, can be done with https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenDRIVE/ASAM_OpenDRIVE_Specification/latest/specification/11_lanes/11_03_lane_sections.html[lane sections] rather than separate road segments.

=== OpenSCENARIO XML
- Whenever possible, make use of OpenSCENARIO XML https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/LongitudinalAction.html[longitudinal] and https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/LateralAction.html[lateral] actions. When that's not feasible, it’s useful to define https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/FollowTrajectoryAction.html[trajectories].

- The shape within the trajectory element should be selected with care. For smooth trajectories, e.g. lane changes, we recommend https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/Nurbs.html[NURBS], with as sparse control points as feasible.

- In general, we encourage to use https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/LanePosition.html[LanePosition] (road, lane, s, laneOffset), or when plausible, https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/RoadPosition.html[RoadPosition] (road, s, t) in favor of https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/WorldPosition.html[WorldPosition] (X, Y). Then actions and trajectories can be parameterized more easily and adapted to various roads, including various curvatures. For inspiration how X, Y positions can be converted into LanePositions, see script example https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/convert_position_type/manipulate_positions.py[manipulate_positions.py].

- Make sure the reference point for vehicles is mid rear axle, projected on ground, as defined https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/06_general_concepts/06_03_coordinate_systems.html#_vehicle_coordinate_system_xv_yv_zv[here] by the standard.

We also get questions what are the most important actions and conditions. It's hard to rank, but here follows a few ones we found useful.

==== Actions
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/TeleportAction.html[TeleportAction] (most often used to establish entity initial position)
- All basic https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/LongitudinalAction.html[longitudinal] and https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/LateralAction.html[lateral] actions
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/AssignRouteAction.html[AssignRouteAction] (to ensure expected and deterministic choices in junctions)
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/FollowTrajectoryAction.html[FollowTrajectoryAction]
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/SpeedProfileAction.html[SpeedProfileAction] (sometimes useful for defining speed while follow trajectory, provides detailed control of speed)
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/SynchronizeAction.html[SynchronizeAction] (useful in NCAP scenarios, for example. See https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/07_components_scenario/07_04_actions.html#_types_of_private_action[here] for further description)
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/EntityAction.html[EntityAction] (Useful for recorded scenarios where road users enters and exits the scene)
- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/ControllerAction.html[ControllerAction] (hand over control to  external function, driver model, driver-in-the-loop...)

==== Conditions
Make use of the AND/OR logics based on combination of conditions and condition groups as described https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/07_components_scenario/07_06_conditions_triggers.html#_triggers_and_condition_groups[here].

Commonly used conditions are:

- https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/RelativeDistanceCondition.html[RelativeDistanceCondition]

[[_scenario_creation_tips_examples]]
=== Examples

Here follows a few scenario examples highlighting various useful features.

To run the examples, grab and unzip the latest esmini *demo* (not bin) package, from https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/latest[here]. The run instructions assume you’re located in esmini root folder.

==== Example 1: scenario_nurb_straight_road
Scenariofile: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_nurb_straight_road.xosc[scenario_nurb_straight_road.xosc]

Target car (blue) cutting in, in front of Ego

video::BnlQYsGqP-k[youtube,width=800,height=450,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

===== About the lane change action
Based on NURBS curve makes it smooth in multiple degrees, and cheap in terms of storage (just a few control points compared to polylines, which typically results in non-continuous tangent and large files due to many vertices).

Position of each control points is defined in terms of road coordinates (s, t), which makes it adapt to whatever road geometry. In other words, it works for any curvature. Further the `s` and `t` coordinates are parametric which makes it easy to customize the characteristics of the lane chance, e.g. duration and adapt to various lane widths.

===== About the speed profile
Compared to a sequence of individual SpeedActions, the SpeedProfile allows for any number of timestamped speed targets within one single action. Additionally, it offers much better control of the resulting profile curve (speed over time). E.g. user can specify max acceleration and jerk avoiding discontinuities.

Run as:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_nurb_straight_road.xosc`

==== Example 2: scenario_nurb_curved_road
Scenariofile: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_nurb_curved_road.xosc[scenario_nurb_curved_road.xosc]

Same as above, but now with a curved road, demonstrating the adaptiveness of the lane change trajectory.

video::p8YqZmDfLbM[youtube,width=800,height=450,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Run as:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_nurb_curved_road.xosc`

==== Example 3: scenario_runner_with_acts
Scenariofile: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_runner_with_acts.xosc[scenario_runner_with_acts.xosc]

Another cut-in scenario. This example demonstrates how scenarios can refer to maneuvers in external catalogs.

video::vpmcrKPz5eU[youtube,width=800,height=450,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

This scenario also makes use of headway time and relative distance conditions to create a combined condition that trigger only when target is ahead of Ego (distance measurements are absolute in OpenSCENARIO). The measurements are performed in road longitudinal coordinates, taking any curvature into account hence making the scenario fit any road geometry.

Run as:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/scenario_construct_examples/scenario_runner_with_acts.xosc`

==== Example 4: ltap-od
Scenariofile: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/resources/xosc/ltap-od.xosc[ltap-od.xosc]

Ego and target approaching intersection from opposites directions. Ego plan to go straight, target plan to turn left. To enforce a critical situation target is assigned a SynchronizeAction which will adapt its speed so that it arrives at the intersection whenever Ego is.

video::PQ3dZJ8wpuI[youtube,width=800,height=450,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

In this example an interactive controller is assigned to Ego, allowing the user to control it with the arrow keys. The controller can be removed or disabled.

Run as:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/ltap-od.xosc`

Drive Ego with arrow keys.

Disable controller:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/ltap-od.xosc --disable_controllers`

==== Example 5: cut-in
Scenariofile: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/dev/resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc[cut-in.xosc]

video::9qvDUpq7XM4[youtube,width=800,height=450,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Red target car drives 20% faster than Ego, so the overtake is inevitable. Target will then perform lane change and brake maneuvers triggered by different HWT conditions.

This scenario demonstrates how SpeedAction can operate in a continuous mode, maintaining a relative speed specified either as offset or factor.

Run as:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Interactive variant:

`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in_interactive.xosc`

Drive with arrow keys, notice how the red car adapts to Ego speed.
