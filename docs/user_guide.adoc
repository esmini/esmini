== Introduction
esmini is a software tool to play OpenSCENARIO files. It's provided both as a stand alone application and as a shared library for linking with custom applications. In addition some tools have been developed to support design and analysis of traffic scenarios.

The scope of this user guide is to provide examples on how to use the tools. It also includes a programming tutorial on how to use esmini in custom applications.

== Getting started
Download latest release from here: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/latest

First time make sure to pick the demo package for your platform (Windows, Linux or Mac). In addition to application binaries it also includes some content like example scenarios and basic 3D models. The binary (bin) packages includes only executables and libraries.

To install the package, just unzip it anywhere. A single subfolder named `esmini` is created. This is the root folder for esmini. No files are stored outside this folder structure and no system files or registry is modified in any way.

=== Run esmini

Try to run one of the examples:

* go to folder esmini/run/esmini
* double click on a .bat file, e.g. `run_cut-in.bat` or run it from a command line. 

These scripts should work on all platforms (in spite extension ".bat").

You can also run the examples explicitly from a command line:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc``

For common Mac issues, please see <<Mac issues and limitations>>.

=== Get complete esmini
The demo package contains only a subset of esmini tools and content (e.g. scenario examples, scripts and models). 

To get the complete content, first download or clone the project from GitHub: https://github.com/esmini/esmini.

Then either build yourself, see step 2 in next chapter <<Build esmini - quick guide>>, or:

. Download pre-built binary package for your system (e.g. esmini-bin_win_x64.zip) from latest release: 
https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases. Copy the content into the esmini-demo folder.
. Download the complete 3D model package from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5gk8bvgzqiaaoco/models.7z?dl=1[here]. Unpack into esmini/resources (it should end up in a `models` subfolder). These assets work on all platforms. The environment models (roads, landscape, buildings...) have been created using https://vires.mscsoftware.com/solutions/3d-environment-road-network[VIRES Road Network Editor].

=== Build esmini - quick guide 

Supported systems: Windows, Linux and Mac.

Make sure you have a C++ compiler and https://cmake.org/[CMake] installed. 

On Linux, e.g. Ubunti, some additional system tools and libraries are needed. Run the following command:

[source]
----
sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libgdal-dev libpoppler-dev libdcmtk-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev curl cmake
----

Now we're ready to build esmini. From esmini root folder:
[source]
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
----

The build process automatically downloads 3rd party library binaries and the complete 3D model package.

After successful build, the binaries will be copied into `esmini/bin` folder. Try from command line:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc``

That's all. Details and variants, see <<Build guide>>.

== Use cases
Here follows basic examples showing some, but not all, features in esmini and companion tools. It should give an idea of the possibilities and limitations. For a full list of features and functions, see <<Command reference>>.

To quickly see available launch options, simply run the corresponding application with no arguments, for example:

``./bin/odrviewer``

=== View a scenario
==== Basic features
Specify a window and scenario file. Example: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

Visualize trails from moving entities: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --trail_mode 3`

Show entities as bounding boxes: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --bounding_boxes`

.Trail and bounding box in combination
image::cut-in_trail_and_bb.png[]

==== Camera control

In addition to several OSG standard camera models esmini adds a set of special purpose camera modes that follows following scenario entities in various ways. Further, the user can add custom cameras via API or launch arguments.

Top level camera mode is selected on keys '1' to '8'. Mode 2-8 are OpenSceneGraph standard cameras. Mode 1 hands over camera control to esmini. In this mode, switch camera model by pressing 'k' which will toggle between all available esmini camera model. 

The default camera model is esmini "orbit" which allows for rotating (left-mouse button), zooming (right-mouse button) and panning (scroll wheel / middle mouse button) while following the first entity.

To follow another vehicle press `Tab` (next vehicle) or `Shift TAB` (previous vehicle). Also `Backspace` is mapped to previous vehicle, since shift-TAB do not work on all platforms.

For a complete list of cameras and functions, see <<Command reference>>.

esmini camera mode can be selected by launch argument. Here are a few common use cases:

Follow exact behind vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode fixed`

Orthogonal (no perspective) top view follow vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode top`

Follow vehicle from inside "driver" point of view: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode driver`

Follow vehicle with some flex and allow rotate, pan and zoom: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --camera_mode flex-orbit`

In addition to pre-defined camera modes, the user can add custom cameras from API or via launch argument. Custom cameras can be fixed, semi-fixed (fixed position but unconstrained orientation) or relative current vehicle. Here is a few examples:

Custom camera in front of vehicle, e.g. sensor mount position:
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_camera 3,0,0.6,0,0`

Custom camera with fixed position but dynamic orientation, always pointing at current vehicle: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_camera 170,10,5`

video::custom_camera_fixed_pos.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
//video::https://github.com/esmini/resources/blob/explore/doc/images/custom_camera_fixed_pos.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop"]
// video::JLrxu2CdX3A[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Custom fixed camera: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_camera 240,15,10,3.5,0.2`

video::custom_camera_fixed_pos_and_rot.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::EWsiYcovCYQ[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Custom fixed top view camera: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --custom_fixed_top_camera 180,-1.54,2301,4.71239`

// video::1Z_pCCbdxBU[youtube,width=640,height=360,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]


==== Some key shortcut commands

[horizontal]
*Space*:: Toggle pause/play simulation
*Enter*:: Step simulation one frame forward
*Tab*:: Move camera to next vehicle
*Shift-Tab or Backspace*:: Move camera to previous vehicle
*'j'*:: Toggle show entity trail points and lines (press mulitpe times to switch modes) 
*','*:: Toggle bounding box modes
*Esc*:: Quit

See <<Command reference>> for a complete list of key shortcut commands.

==== Road network visualization
Visualize OpenDRIVE road features: +
`./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --road_features on`

If a 3D model representation of the road network is missing (i.e. empty or missing SceneGraphFile element of the https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.1.1_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/RoadNetwork.html[OpenSCENARIO RoadNetwork class]), then esmini will generate a _very_ simple model. 

Example: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc``

Add optional flat ground plane: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --ground_plane``

The generated model can be saved: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --save_generated_model`` +
Then look for `generated_road.osgb` in the current directory.

==== Background color
esmini default background color is skyish, light blue. Change by launch argument --clear-color <r,g,b>, where r, g, b are the red, green, blue components as floating numbers in the range (0:1). Some examples: 

Black background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 0,0,0``

White background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 1,1,1``

Gray background: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --clear-color 0.3,0.3,0.3``

==== Anti-alias
esmini make use of OpenSceneGraph sub-sampling method for anti-alias. Default setting is 4 (samples). This can be controlled by the launch argument `--aa_mode <samples>`. To disable anti-alias: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --aa_mode 0``

=== Screenshots and video clips 
esmini can save screenshots in uncompressed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA[TGA] format. These images can be converted into other image formats or even video clips in a post process.

esminiLib also supports grabbing screenshots via API, also from a pure off-screen rendering setup (requiring neither monitor nor graphics hardware). See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture[image-capture] code example.

Here follows a few examples using launch arguments and runtime key commands.

==== Save screenshots
Press 'c' at any time to store a single screenshot.

Press 'C' at any time to start storing screen shot for every frame onward. Press 'C' again to stop.

==== Create video clip of a scenario
First, run the scenario and automatically save screenshots for all frames: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.033 --capture_screen``

[Note]
==== 
**Note** We added the --fixed_timestep argument to make sure we get a smooth video with constant delta-time for a smooth and continuous video clip. If --fixed_timestep is skipped esmini will progress time between frames according to actual system time passed since last frame, which can vary over time for many reasons (e.g. due to esmini or other processes CPU load).
====

Then, create a video clip using ffmpeg: +
``ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -crf 20 out.mp4``

The above ffmpeg command will create a MPEG4 video with reasonable compression (crf 20). To create a lossless, but still compressed, video e.g. for further post processing:

``ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 30 -i screen_shot_%5d.tga -c:v libx264 -qp 0 out.mp4``

Get ffmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Some details regarding H.264 encoding can be found https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264[here].

==== Off-screen rendering

Whenever esmini is launched with the `--window <x-pos> <y-pos> <width> <height>` argument a viewer will be created with specified window. The `--headless` flag controls whether any window will be "on screen" or only off-screen. Of course, `--headless` in combination with no window (no --window argument) will skip rendering altogether, which is a very performance-saving mode to use when possible.

Example: +
``./bin/esmini.exe --window 60 60 4000 2000 --headless --capture_screen --osc .\resources\xosc\cut-in.xosc`` +
will render images into a virtual frame buffer of size 4k x 2k pixels and then store to file. Note: The size of the virtual frame buffer is not limited by size of any connected display.

To run esmini completely without rendering, just omit the --window argument: +
``./bin/esmini.exe --osc .\resources\xosc\cut-in.xosc`` --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat +
will run the specified scenario quickly and store a .dat file for later analysis or viewing (with replayer).

*Note:* If --fixed_timestep is omitted esmini will adapt timesteps to actual frametime, so a 30 seconds scenario will take 30 seconds - i.e. no performance gain.

==== Software rendering (no gfx hw)

By default any available 3D graphics hardware will be utilized. As fallback esmini (via OSG) will utilize https://www.mesa3d.org[Mesa3D] which is a software implementation of the OpenGL graphics stack including parts normally hosted in the graphics hardware system. The Mesa3D approach is useful when running on cloud/cluster machines lacking graphics hardware, perhaps even lacking a window system (like slimmed and headless Ubuntu without X11 support). 

*Mesa3D on Linux* +
Mesa3D is normally installed with Linux distributions. Check OpenGL support with the following command: + 
``glxinfo -B`` 

If the command is not available, then Mesa3D utility package is probably missing. Install as: +
``sudo apt install mesa-utils``

To run headless with a virtual frame buffer: 

- Activate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb[xvfb]: +
``Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24+32 & export DISPLAY=:99`` +
- Then run esmini as usual

For troubleshooting, the following command might give information about the graphics system: +
``lspci -vnn | grep VGA -A 12``

*Mesa3D on Windows* +

- Grab the Mesa3D binary from https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest[here]. 
- Unpack and place opengl32.dll in the same folder as esmini executable.
- Then run esmini as usual

=== Logging
esmini can produce log files in different formats and for different purposes, explained next.

==== The basic text log file
By default esmini is creating a `log.txt` in the folder from which esmini is launched. In case of esminiLib it will end up in the folder that the application linking esminiLib was launched from.

The log.txt includes the same information normally seen in the terminal window (stdout). 

To disable output to terminal: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --disable_stdout``

To disable creation of the logfile (`log.txt`): +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --disable_log``

Developer info: Define the symbol DEBUG_TRACE (either as compile flag or by uncomment https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/73390cc2c1b8cbb8403950c905515e304c861b8c/EnvironmentSimulator/Modules/CommonMini/CommonMini.cpp#L34[this code line]) to log more details, like what code module and line number is the origin of the log entry.

==== Scenario recording (.dat)
In addition esmini can save a `.dat` file which captures the state of all entities. This file can later be used either to replay (see <<Replay scenario>>) the scenario or converted to `.csv` for further analysis, e.g. in Excel.

To create a recording with regular timesteps: +
``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --record sim.dat``

To convert the .dat file into .csv, do either of: +
``./bin/dat2csv sim.dat`` +
or +
``python ./scripts/dat2csv.py sim.dat``

==== CSV logger
To create a more complete csv logfile, compared to the content of the .dat file, activate the CSV_Logger:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --csv_logger full_log.csv``

full_log.csv will contain more detailed states for all scenario entities. To also include collision detection: +

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.05 --csv_logger full_log.csv --collision``

All collisions (overlap) between entity bounding boxes will be registered in the `collision_ids` column of each entity. It will contain the IDs of any entities overlapping at given frame.

=== Replay scenario

Replay a scenario recording (.dat file): +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --file sim.dat``

The `--res_path` is a special path directive should normally point to esmini/resources folder, where it will look for the OpenDRIVE file, 3D models and model_ids table (model_ids.txt). It also works to add one or multiple --path <path> directives, like for esmini.

Once loaded the scenario recording will start playing in normal speed. Here are a few key commands:

[horizontal]
*Space*:: Toggle pause/play simulation
*Tab*:: Move camera to next vehicle
*Shift-Tab or Backspace*:: Move camera to previous vehicle
*'n'*:: Toggle show active trajectories
*','*:: Toggle bounding box modes
*Esc*:: Quit

Arrow keys:
[horizontal]
*Left*:: Pause and move to previous frame
*Right*:: Pause and move to next frame
*Shift + Left*:: Pause and jump 10 frames back
*Shift + Right*:: Pause and jump 10 frames forward
*Ctrl + Left*:: Jump to beginning
*Ctrl + Right*:: Jump to end

See <<Command reference>> for a complete list of key shortcut commands.

Some launch arguments:
[horizontal]
*--collision*:: Pause and move to previous frame
*--quit_at_end*:: Quit application when reaching end of scenario
*--repeat*:: Loop scenario
*--dir <path>*:: Directory containing replays to overlay, pair with "file" argument, where "file" is .dat filename match substring

Examples:

Enable collision detection and pause playing at every occasion of collision:  +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim.dat --res_path ./resources --collision``

.Video clip demonstrating some features in replayer
video::ltap-od_collision.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::54NWtG1MsRk[youtube,width=800,height=400,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

The .dat file in the clip above was created with the command: +
``./bin/esmini --headless --osc ./resources/xosc/ltap-od.xosc --disable_controllers --fixed_timestep 0.033 --record sim.dat ``

and then launched in replayer:

``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim.dat --res_path ./resources --collision``

*Note:* The --disable_controllers flag is just specified to disable the interactive controller that normally is activated in that specific scenario. For more information about controllers, see https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/docs/Controllers.md[Controllers in esmini].

Next example, play multiple variants of a scenario in parallel: +
``./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --file sim --res_path ./resources --capture_screen --dir tmp``

The `--dir` argument points to a folder containing sim1.dat, sim2.dat and sim3.dat.

.Video clip demonstrating parallel scenarios in replayer
video::replay_multiple_scenario_variants.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]
// video::KqoTmAE9NmI[youtube,width=800,height=400,opts="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

Combine esmini and replayer in a one-liner command:
``./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --record sim.dat --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc;./bin/replayer --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ./resources --file sim.dat``

=== View road network

==== Visualize OpenDRIVE geometry

By default odrviewer will create a simple 3D model of the OpenDRIVE description and populate it with sparse traffic: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr``

Add OpenDRIVE features, like reference line and lanes, on top (toggle on 'o'): +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --road_features``

Remove all traffic, just visualize the road geometry: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --density 0``

==== Evaluate OpenDRIVE connectivity

Increase traffic to exercise all junctions and lanes of the road network: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --density 7 --road_features``

Use custom 3D model: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --model ./resources/models/fabriksgatan.osgb --density 5``

Slow down traffic: +
``./bin/odrviewer --window 60 60 800 400 --odr ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr --model ./resources/models/fabriksgatan.osgb --density 3 --speed_factor 0.6``

==== Inspect OpenDRIVE geometry and road IDs 

esmini odrplot is a small application that creates a track.csv file that can be plotted with another small Python script xodr.py: +
``./bin/odrplot ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr`` +
``./EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/odrplot/xodr.py track.csv``

Combine in a one-liner: +
``./bin/odrplot ./resources/xodr/fabriksgatan.xodr;./EnvironmentSimulator/Applications/odrplot/xodr.py track.csv``

To navigate in the plot, click the four-arrow icon (see image below) and then use mouse according to:
[horizontal]
*Left button*:: Pan (move left, right, up, down)
*Right button*:: Zoom

image::odrplot_help.png[]

=== Plot scenario data
esmini provides a Python based script, plot_dat.py, to plot information in .dat files.

First, create a .dat file. For that we don't need a window. Run esmini headless: +
``./bin/esmini --headless --fixed_timestep 0.05 --osc ./resources/xosc/acc-test.xosc --record sim.dat``

The scenario looks like this: +

video::acc-test.mp4?raw=true[opts="loop,autoplay"]

Next, plot speed over time: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed``

image::plot_dat.png[]

To see what parameters are available for plot: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --list_params``

will output a list similar to: +
``
Plottable parameters: +
id, model_id, obj_type, obj_category, ctrl_type, time, speed, wheel_angle, wheel_rot, centerOffsetX, centerOffsetY, centerOffsetZ, width, length, height, scaleMode, visibilityMask, x, y, z, h, p, r, roadId, laneId, offset, t, s
``

Most parameters does normally not make sense to plot, but it depends on the test case. Maybe it's interesting to see when a car makes a lane change. Plot laneId over time: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param laneId``

image::plot_dat_lane_id.png[]

A plot can show multiple parameters: +
``./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param laneId --param speed``

image::plot_dat_lane_speed.png[]

=== Save OSI data
esmini can provide OSI groundtruth data in three ways:

. Send over UDP
. API to fetch via function call from a custom application
. Save to OSI trace file

Only trace file way is described here. To save OSI data, add argument `--osi_file [filename]`. The filename is optional. If omitted it will be named `ground_truth.osi`. Example:

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc --osi_file``

will create `ground_truth.osi`` in the current folder. The format is according to the OSI standard "Binary trace file", see OSI documentation https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-documentation/index.html#_osi_trace_files[2.2.6 OSI trace files].

esmini provides a script, osi2csv.py, that converts an OSI trace file into .csv format. The script can also serve as example how to parse and extract data from an OSI trace file:

``./scripts/osi2csv.py ground_truth.osi``

will create ground_truth.csv.

(if file type association is not setup, try: ``python ./scripts/osi2csv.py ground_truth.osi``)

== Scenario features
=== Speed profile
(introduced in esmini v2.23.0)

The OpenSCENARIO https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.1.1_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/SpeedAction.html[SpeedAction] will reach a specified speed in a way described by additional attributes, e.g. shape and duration. To achieve multiple speed target over time you would need to add multiple SpeedAction events to the scenario. Moreover, there is no way to explicitly control the jerk (acceleration/deceleration rates). 

However with the SpeedProfileAction (introduced in OpenSCENARIO v1.2) you can specify a series of speed targets over time, in one action. Optionally you can also specify dynamic constraints for jerk (gradually changing acceleration and deceleration), acceleration and speed.

If you run the example scenario https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc[speed-profile.xosc] as follows:

[source]
----
./bin/esmini.exe --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat
./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed
----
you should get the following plotted speed curves:

image::speed-profile1.png[]

*Note:* You might need to add ``python`` or ``python2`` in front of the python command. And matplotlib is needed, see odrplot in <<Tools overview>>.

*Tip:* For quick experiments, skip the visualization and bring the plot asap by replacing the two commands with: 
[source]
----
./bin/esmini.exe --headless --osc ./resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc --fixed_timestep 0.01 --record sim.dat;./scripts/plot_dat.py sim.dat --param speed
----

The scenario includes two cars with identical speed profiles with one exception: The white Car1 use activate dynamic constraints by setting FollowingMode="follow" while the red Car2 will apply constant acceleration (linear interpolation) between speed targets by setting FollowingMode="position".

The action for white car:

[source,xml]
----
<SpeedProfileAction followingMode="follow">
    <DynamicConstraints
        maxAcceleration = "5.0"
        maxDeceleration = "10.0"
        maxAccelerationRate = "4.0"
        maxDecelerationRate = "3.0"
        maxSpeed = "50"
    />
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="4.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="2.0" speed="8.0"/>
</SpeedProfileAction>
----

The time values are relative each other and start of the action. In this case the action is triggered at simulation time = 2 seconds. Initial speed for both cars is 0. First entry has therefor no effect since it applies speed = 0 at time = 2 (2 + 0). After additional 4 seconds (sim time = 6s) the speed target is 10 m/s. At sim time 10s the speed target is 4 m/s and finally after 2 more seconds the final speed target value is 8.0 m/s.

The "follow" mode deserves some additional explanation. As shown in the figure, it start and ends with zero acceleration. Then is basically will try to match the acceleration "lines" but cutting the corners according to acceleration and deceleration rate constraints. This way the intermediate speed values will not always be reached. However, the final speed value will be reached. 

If the target speed or accelerations can't be reached with given constraints the action will revert to linear mode (FollowingMode="position") for the remainder of the profile. This "failure" is logged. 

Another approach would be to try to perform a best effort, but that would require additional input to decide whether to prioritize reaching specified speed targets or respect time stamps...


[Note]
====
**Note**: The implementation of this feature is preliminary and experimental. Behavior and details might change. 
====

Let's manipulate the scenario in different ways to illustrate some special cases of the speed-profile feature.

==== Special case: Single entry
(Special case implementation introduced in esmini v2.23.1)

Compared to SpeedAction, the SpeedProfileAction offers more tools in terms of dynamic constraints. Hence it can be actually be useful also for single entry, i.e. reach a single target speed. 

The implementation differs for the single entry case. Target speed will be reached if constraints allows for it. If not, the speed will still be reached, but later than specified. 

There are three sub cases:

*1. Speed can be reached within time*

The speed profile will contain three phases: Jerk, constant acceleration, jerk.

Example: +
Replace the four entries in speed-profile.xosc with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile5.png[]

Initial positive jerk will be applied until necessary acceleration is reached. Keep constant acceleration (linear segment in the speed profile) until negative jerk needs to be applied in order to reach target speed on time and at zero acceleration.

*2. Speed can't be reached in time due to acceleration constraints*

This speed profile will also contain three phases: Jerk, constant acceleration, jerk.

Example: +
Replace the four entries in speed-profile.xosc with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="0.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile6.png[]

Initial positive jerk will be applied until maximum acceleration is reached (or maximum deceleration). Keep constant acceleration (linear segment in the speed profile) until negative jerk needs to be applied in order to reach target speed at zero acceleration. Due to the acceleration limitation there will be a delay as well. The log file will include something like:

[source]
----
SpeedProfile: Constraining acceleration from 5.86 to 5.00
SpeedProfile: Extend 0.46 s
----

*3. Speed can't be reached in time due to jerk constraints*

This speed profile will contain only two jerk phases.

Example: +
Keep entries from last case, but change jerk settings as follows:

[source,xml]
----
  maxAccelerationRate="3.0" 
  maxDecelerationRate="2.0" 
----

image::speed-profile7.png[]

In this case the jerk settings are too weak to reach target speed in time. Not enough acceleration can be achieved in the given time window. 

Positive jerk will be applied until negative jerk has to be applied in order to reach target speed at zero acceleration. Hence there is no room for a phase of constant acceleration. Due to the jerk limitation there will be a delay. The log file will include something like:

[source]
----
SpeedProfile: Can't reach target speed 10.00 on target time 3.00s with given jerk constraints, extend to 4.08s
----

==== What if current speed differ from the first entry?
Replace the four entries with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="0.0" speed="3.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="4.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile2.png[]

What we see here is that for linear mode (FollowingMode="position") the speed of the first entry will apply immediately regardless of the current speed at the time of the action being triggered. For constrained mode (FollowingMode="follow") we see that the initial speed value (3.0) is overridden by the current speed (0.0). From there it will strive for the second entry, obeying the constraints. 

The overall idea with the "follow" mode is to maintain continuity in the speed profile, up to jerk degree.

==== What if time is missing in entry?

Replace any entries with the following ones:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry speed="10.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile3.png[]

Specified max acceleration will be applied until target speed is reached. Note: In the non-linear case and with multiple entries, the function will fail if the specified acceleration can't be reached with given jerk constraints (maxAcceleration and maxDeceleration). Try to lower the maxAcceleration/deceleration in this case.

You can also combine entries with and without time constraint, like in following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry speed="10.0"/>
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="15.0"/>
----

image::speed-profile4.png[]

Car will accelerate until speed 10 m/s is reached, then spend 3 seconds to reach 15 m/s.

==== Initial acceleration taken into account
(from release v2.23.2)

What if the acceleration is not zero when the SpeedProfileAction is started, for example interrupting an ongoing SpeedAction in Follow mode?

To maintain a continuous acceleration profile the action will use current acceleration as initial value. The standard states that the acceleration is expected to be zero at start and end of the action. The esmini interpretation is that the CHANGE is zero at start while the ACTUAL value is zero at end (since the action can only control acceleration while being active, not before).

Example:
Once again starting from https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/resources/xosc/speed-profile.xosc[speed-profile.xosc], instead of setting an instant initial speed make it ramp up from 0 to 5 m/s over a duration of 4 seconds by tweaking the initial speed actions, for both entities, as below:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedActionDynamics dynamicsShape="linear" value="5.0" dynamicsDimension="time"/>
    <SpeedActionTarget>
        <AbsoluteTargetSpeed value="4.0"/>
    </SpeedActionTarget>
----

image::speed-profile8.png[]

The initial speed action will apply constant acceleration until time = 2.0 seconds, when the SpeedProfileAction is triggered. While the linear profile will jump to 0 m/s (as specified in first entry) the follow mode profile will just apply necessary jerk to reach target acceleration with respect to following entries.

Initial acceleration is also respected for the special case of a single entry, for example:

[source,xml]
----
    <SpeedProfileEntry time="3.0" speed="10.0"/>
----

the result becomes:

image::speed-profile9.png[]

== OpenSceneGraph and 3D models

http://www.openscenegraph.org/[OpenSceneGraph] (osg) includes readers and writers for quite a few 3D file formats. It comes with a demo application, http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/user-guides/55-osgconv[osgconv], a command line tool that simply takes one file as input and outputs the same content in a different format. 

Examples:

Convert from fbx to osgb format: +
`osgconv car.fbx car.osgb`

Convert from osgb to https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview[fbx] format: +
`osgconv car.osgb car.fbx`

osgconv has a lot of useful options. Run `osgconv -h` for more info. Here's a few examples:

``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb --compressed`` will compress and embed textures +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -t 1,5,7`` will translate the model (x=1, y=5, z=7) +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -o -90-1,0,0`` will rotate the model (rotate -90 deg around X-axis) +
``osgconv in.fbx out.osgb -o -90-1,0,0 --use-world-frame`` as above but pivot point world origin +

osg native format is `osgb` which stands for OpenSceneGraph binary format. It's a stable and compact (quick to load) format, which also can embed textures and animations. Thanks to the osgconv tool, esmini can get away with only supporting the .osgb format and still indirectly support many other 3D formats.

=== Get osgconv
On Linux and Mac its recommended to build osg yourself. You can try this script: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/compile_osg_apps_linux.sh[compile_osg_apps_linux.sh]. It will first fetch and install https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0[FBX SDK] and then build OSG with FBX support. Find more details and instructions in the header of the script.

For more info regarding building OSG for Linux, here's a great guide: +
https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/osg-linux-quick-install/  +
But note that it does not consider FBX support.

For Windows there's an option to grab pre-built binaries including FBX support from here: +
https://objexx.com/OpenSceneGraph.html

Here follows an example of how to convert .osgb models into .fbx format for use in the Unity3D framework.

=== Convert osgb models for use in Unity
. Open a command prompt in the folder where your model.osgb is
. Run command: +
   `osgconv model.osgb out/model.fbx -s 100,100,100` +
   "-s ..." is for scaling which typically is needed for fbx files. 
   Potentially it also needs to be oriented according to Unity coordinate system. In that case try: +
   `osgconv model.osgb out/model.fbx -s 100,100,100 --use-world-frame -o 120--0.5773503,-0.5773503,-0.5773503`

A folder named "out" should have been created and including the model.fbx plus any texture files

=== Import into Unity
. Drag the resulting fbx file, and all textures, into a unity project, preferably an empty folder
. Add the model to the Scene hierarchy
. Select the model and int the "Inspector", select the "Materials" tab
. Change the "Location" to "Use External Materials (Legacy)" and click "Apply"
. Open the automatically created "Materials" folder (next to the model file)
. Select all materials and change +
   for standard template: "Rendering Mode" to "Cutout" (good default option)  +
   for HDRP template: "Surface type" to "Transparent" and check "alpha clipping"

That should basically be it.

== Support / Q&A

=== Resources not found
There are no fixed structure where scenario resources, e.g. vehicle 3D model or controller catalog, needs to be stored. Instead, additional search paths can be added by launch argument `--path <path>`. For example: +

``./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/slow-lead-vehicle.xosc --path ../../ --path c:/tmp/my_models``

will add the relative path `../../` and absolute path `c:/tmp/my_models` to the list of places where to look for resources referred to by the scenario.

=== Mac issues and limitations
* Window can't be located in the upper part of the screen. If window won't open, try to adjust the y value (second entry) of the window argument. 60 pixels usually works fine, e.g: `./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc`

* Graphics can not run in separate thread. Hence the `--thread` launch flag will have no effect. 

* On Mac the zip-package might be put in quarantine, to release it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine file.zip` or even better: `xattr -c file.zip`

* If you get the "damaged file" message: Please open a terminal in the folder where the esmini-demo was extracted, and run the following command: `xattr -c -r esmini-demo`

=== Issues at esmini GitHub page
The https://github.com/esmini/esmini/issues[Issues tab at esmini GitHub page] is a valuable source of questions and answers. To search in all issues, make sure to set filter: `is:issue`.

== Build guide 

=== Build configurations
https://cmake.org/[CMake] tool is used to create standard make configurations. A few example "create..." batch scripts are supplied as examples how to generate desired build setup. 

- VisualStudio / win64 / Windows SDK v10 / Release and Debug
- Ubuntu and Kubuntu (tested on 18.04) / gcc / Release and Debug

However, it should be possible to configure custom variants using cmake. For example to use Visual Studio 2019 run the following commands from command prompt (CMD or PowerShell), assuming starting point is esmini root folder:

....
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
....

This will first generate Visual Studio solution and then compile esmini using MSVC toolset v142 (default with Visual Studio 2019). Default architecture is x64.

If you want to compile with MSVC 2017 toolset just add directive to the generator as follows:

``
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T v141 .. 
``

A complete list of supported toolsets are available https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.17/variable/MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION.html[here].

If you want to specify architecture you simply add -A x64 or -A Win32. So for example, if you want to compile with MSVC 2015 toolset and for win32 use the following generator command:

``
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T v140 -A Win32 .. 
``

Of course, building with a specific toolset requires it to be installed. Use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019[Visual Studio Installer]. Steps:

- choose "Modify"
- make sure Desktop Development with C++ is checked
- go to tab "Individual components" 
- scroll down to "Compilers, build tools, and runtimes"
- check the MSVC versions you need, e.g. "MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C++ build tools (v14.00)" and "MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)"

All configurations defines an "Install" build target that compiles (if needed) and copies relevant binaries into a common "esmini/bin" folder recognized by the example scripts under the "esmini/run" folder.

*Note:*

- For automatic downloading of external dependencies (OSG binaries) and 3D models, CMake version 3.11.4 or above is required (FetchContent_MakeAvailable was introduced). +

- In Windows, if you get an error like "the c compiler identification is unknown", then please make sure to install "Windows Universal CRT SDK" from the Visual Studio Installer tool.

=== External dependencies

esmini is designed to link all dependencies statically. Main reason is to have a all-inclusive library for easy integration either as a shared library/DLL (e.g. plugin in Unity, or S-function in Simulink) or statically linked into a native application.

*Note:* Nothing stops you from going with all dynamic linking, it's just that provided build scripts are not prepared for it.

CMake scripts will download several pre-compiled 3rd party packages and 3D model resource files. 

Default location for these resources is Google drive. If there is an issue, try switch to the backup location at Dropbox by changing the following line in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt[EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt]:

``set ( FILE_STORAGE "google" )`` + 
to + 
``set ( FILE_STORAGE "dropbox" )`` +

Links to all packages can be found in https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt[EnvironmentSimulator/CMakeLists.txt].

If you need to (re)build a 3rd party lib for some reason, e.g. for an yet unsupported system or need for a specific version, these build scripts might be a starting point:

- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osg_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osg_libs.sh]
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osi_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osi_libs.sh]
- https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_sumo_libs.sh[scripts/generate_sumo_libs.sh]

or this script that builds all three libs, combining the above ones:

https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osi_sumo_osg_libs.sh[scripts/generate_osi_sumo_osg_libs.sh]

=== Additional platform dependencies

Linux Ubuntu 18.04

[source]
----
sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libgdal-dev libpoppler-dev libdcmtk-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev curl cmake
----

Also, g++ version >= 5 is needed for c++14 code support.

Windows and Mac: Install the https://cmake.org/[cmake] application

=== Dynamic protobuf linking
When linking esmini with software already dependent on Google protobuf there might be need for dynamic linking of shared protobuf library. This can be achieved by defining cmake symbol DYN_PROTOBUF as following example:

``cmake -D DYN_PROTOBUF=True ..``

Then build as usual. It will link with protobuf shared library instead of linking with a static library.

When running esmini protobuf shared library need to be available. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the folder where the library is, example:

``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./externals/OSI/linux/lib-dyn``

*Note:* +
The dynamic versions of protobuf were added Aug 31 2021. So you might need to update the OSI library package. Get the latest from following links:

- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/an58ckp2qfx5069/osi_v10.7z?dl=0[OSI Windows]
- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kwtdg0c1c8pawa1/osi_linux.7z?dl=0[OSI Linux]
- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/m62v19gp0m73dte/osi_mac.7z?dl=0[OSI Mac]

=== Slim esmini - customize configration

The external dependencies OSG, OSI and SUMO are optional. Also the unit test suite is optional, in effect making the dependecy to googletest framework optional as well. All these options are simply controlled by the following cmake options:

- USE_OSG
- USE_OSI
- USE_SUMO
- USE_GTEST

So, for example, to cut dependency to OSG and SUMO, run:  +
``cmake -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False ..``

To disable OSG, SUMO, OSI and googletest, run:  +
``cmake -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False -D USE_OSI=False -D USE_GTEST=False ..``

All options are enabled/True as default.

*Note:* +
Disabling an external dependency will disable corresponding functionality. So, for example, disabling OSI means that no OSI data can be created by esmini. Disabling OSG means that esmini can't visualize the scenario. However it can still run the scenario and create a .dat file, which can be played and visualized later in another esmini build in which OSG is enabled (even on another platform).

=== MSYS2 / MinGW-w64 support

esmini slim can be compiled and executed in the MSYS2 environment. Try following steps:

* Download MSYS2 from: https://www.msys2.org
* Install with default options  
* Start MSYS2 MinGW x64 (e.g. from start menu)
* Update MSYS2 packages, run: +
  ``
  pacman -Syu --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm 
  `` +
  (MSYS2 should close automatically)
* Restart MSYS2
* Finalize update and install needed packages, run:

[source]
----
pacman -Su --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm 
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm 
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm 
----

* Optional (not needed to compile or run esmini): +
  ``pacman -S git --disable-download-timeout --noconfirm``

* Build esmini (from MSYS2 MinGW x64 command line):

[source]
----    
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D USE_OSG=False -D USE_SUMO=False -D USE_OSI=False -D USE_GTEST=False ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
----

=== Build esmini project
First generate build configuration (see above)

Then it should work on all platform to build using cmake as follows: +
``cmake --build . --config Release --target install``

Or you can go with platform specific ways of building:

*Windows/Visual Studio* 

. Open generated solution, build*/EnvironmentSimulator.sln
. Select configuration, Debug or Release
. Build CMakePredefinedTargets/INSTALL (right-click and select build)

*macOS*

To generate a Xcode project file, run the initial cmake command as follows: +
``cmake -G Xcode ..``

Then build as usual: +
``cmake --build . --config Release --target install``

or using Xcode directly: +
``xcodebuild -scheme install -configuration Release build``

or open the generated project file in Xcode, and build from there.

To create bundles (shared library container), do from esmini root folder: +

[source]
----
lipo -create bin/libesminiRMLib.dylib -output bin/esminiRMLib.bundle
lipo -create bin/libesminiLib.dylib -output bin/esminiLib.bundle
----

*Linux*

Once `cmake ..` has created the build configuration, of course you can build by calling the gnu `make` applciation directly instead of going via `cmake --build` as described above.

[source]
----
cd build
make -j4 install
----

This will build all projects, in four parallel jobs, and copy the binaries into a dedicated folder found by the demo batch scripts. 

=== CentOS 7 (Linux)

CentOS 7 has some limitations, e.g. old versions of C/C\++ compiler toolkits and runtimes. So it's not possible to link with provided 3rd party binary libraries targeting Ubuntu 18++.
However, by disabling some featuers in esmini, e.g. OSI and SUMO, it can still be used for previewing scenarios.

== esmini lib programming

=== About the lib itself

The main idea with esmini lib is to provide a limited, simplifed but useful API to the complex world of esmini, OpenSCENARIO and traffic simulation. By making use of only standard C types it has been possible to wrap and use the library in numerous environments, like for example MATLAB, Simulink and Unity (C#).

esmini lib is a, so called, shared library which is linked dynamically with a custom application. This means that it's not linked statically with the application, instead it's loaded whenever the application is launched. An obvious advantage with shared libraries is that they can be shared between multiple applications, reducing size and potentially simplify maintenance. 

An additional important advantage with dynamic linking is that the library can be updated without need to recompile the custom application making use of the library (however it can't be updated during runtime, only in between launches). An obvious requirement is that the API is compatible when replacing a library with a different version, since the API is established at link-time. On the other side of the "same coin", a disadvantage with dynamic linking is that you need to have the shared library present at run-time. 

Although esmini lib is a shared library itself, it includes everything needed in terms of 3rd party functionality. It's actally linking all dependencies statically. Think about it as a single container including everything needed, e.g. support for 3D graphics, XML, expressions, and SUMO traffic simulation. There are two advantages with this approach: 1. Getting rid of dependency to hundreds of 3rd party shared libraries and 2. The linker makes sure to only include relevant functions which reduce the size by extreme (compared to bundle individual and complete shared libraries).

=== How to interact with esmini lib API

Below is a typical interaction between a custom application (e.g. vehicle simulator) and esmini (providing simulation of the environment, like road and traffic).

=== Functionality
No systematic documentation available. See header files https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiLib/esminiLib.hpp[esminiLib.hpp] and https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/EnvironmentSimulator/Libraries/esminiRMLib/esminiRMLib.hpp[esminiRMLib.hpp] for API details.

The following section covers some specific use cases of the library.

==== Save or grab images

Screenshots can be controlled via the API:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_SaveImagesToFile(int nrOfFrames);
----
nrOfFrames: -1 => continuously, 0 => stop, > 0 => number of frames, e.g. 1=next frame only, 2=next two frames

Images will be stored in current folder with name `screen_shot_*.tga` (* = counter) for post processing.

Images can also be saved to memory for instant processing. Control the feature with:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_SaveImagesToRAM(bool state);
----
state: true => capture images, false => don't capture (default, might improve performance on some systems)

Grab image with:

[source, c++]
----
int SE_FetchImage(SE_Image *image);
----
image is a reference to a SE_Image struct which will contain the image meta and image data

See https://github.com/esmini/esmini/tree/master/EnvironmentSimulator/code-examples/image-capture[image-capture] code example.

[Note]
==== 
**Note:** In order to grab a rendered frame image, it must have been saved to RAM during the post rendering phase. First frame will be saved to RAM by default. The SE_SaveImagesToRAM() function must be used to enable the feature for frames > 0. 

The reason for not enable always by default is performance savings. On some system the operation to read back rendered pixels from graphics frame buffer to application RAM memory is not neglectable (depending on whether color coding or byte order transformation is needed). So a compromize is to have the feature enabled for the first init frame, and then activate by user when needed.
====

Finally, to disable esmini image handling altogether and revert to OSG default handling, make the following call before SE_Init():

``SE_SetOffScreenRendering(false);``

Note that disabling the this will permanently disable the callback mechanism for the complete esmini session (overriding any SE_SaveImagesToRAM() call).
