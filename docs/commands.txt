      relative frequence for writing the .osi file e.g. --osi_freq=2 -> we write every two simulation steps

The graphics engine (OpenSceneGraph) provides some additional options, here are a few useful ones: 
 
  --window <x y w h>
      Set the position (x,y) and size (w,h) of the viewer window.
  --screen <num>    
      Set the screen to use when multiple screens are present.
  --clear-color <color>
      Set the background color of the viewer in the form
  --borderless-window <x y w h>
      Set the position (x,y) and size (w,h) of a borderless viewer window.
